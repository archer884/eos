:p
I started work on a new one. Just to have something set more in another world.
Just in case people don't wanna read modern fantasy for the next couple years after this mess. /shrug
It's actually an old one, though.

How's that one going?
archer884Today at 10:07 PM
I think the first chapter is pretty strong.
Oh, I told you about that. For some reason, sitting at one computer makes it impossible to remember stuff you did at the other.
You saw the intro.
I haven't decided what to do with it this time. Something different from last time.
Silver13Today at 10:09 PM
Oh right.
that one had Thorne in it.
archer884Today at 10:09 PM
I go from Thorne's return home to some random guy named Salter.
Salter is a merchant who just arrived in the capital with a shipment of something that he learns, thanks to the empire winning the war, is now practically worthless.
He bumps into a man who agrees to buy it at half price (much more money than he would have gotten) and has to think it over. He's pretty sure the guy is a pirate.
I have no clue what I'm going to do with Salter.
Silver13Today at 10:12 PM
Sounds like you need to map out your thoughts on that a bit.
archer884Today at 10:13 PM
I'm leaning toward, "They both get drunk, and Thorne challenges Salter to a fight."
Silver13Today at 10:13 PM
That sounds hot.  /coughs
archer884Today at 10:14 PM
lol. Really?
You like the idea of a "pretty boy" in a duel? :p
Silver13Today at 10:14 PM
Of course I do.
I'd pay money to watch Jason Mamoa fight someone.
archer884Today at 10:17 PM
lol.
I expect that the fight would be interrupted before anything could happen, because Salter isn't actually a nobleman; he's of the merchant class, not the upper class.
I think his ship captain, a guy called Grambler, is probably going to interrupt and kick the shit out of Thorne in a fistfight, because Thorne is still a month shy of 17 and still doesn't shave.

Hahahahaha
archer884Today at 10:20 PM
That's meant to kind of offset this...
Specifically, I'm talking about a part near the middle-ish where Thorne relays his experience of the battle. Just including the rest for context.

Peters finds a little dried blood on Thorne's sword and demands to know whose it is. Thorne at first declines to answer, then says this:

Thorne laughed---a sound like a puppy being stabbed. He fell onto his side and lay there, laughing, never knowing the joke. "There was a gun captain," he said. "And his loaders. And the man at the trigger. There were men hauling shells. There was one pointing a rifle at me. It's their blood. It's all of their blood. The stains on the grip are mine."
Silver13Today at 10:23 PM
Ohh, he would rather say it's his than the truth.
archer884Today at 10:24 PM
Huh? No, he says whose it all is.
"The stains on the grip are mine."
That's his blood.
Buuuut the others...
This passage is meant to relay the fact that this sixteen year old kid just killed at least seven men.
Silver13Today at 10:25 PM
Ohhhh, ok.
archer884Today at 10:28 PM
I'm hoping that is shocking to some people. :p
Maybe, in a fantasy novel, it won't even register. /shrug
Silver13Today at 10:29 PM
It prolly will impact people.  That's still pretty out there by most people's standards.
archer884Today at 10:31 PM
My plan is to revisit it during the bar scene when one of Thorne's comrades in arms approaches him about it.
You know, just to make it clear that most people in battle never kill anyone.
Silver13Today at 10:32 PM
Yuh.
I've read about that.
