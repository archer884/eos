The girls saw him first. They spotted him coming up the pike, between the silver-barked trees of the estate, and they ran down the road until the gateman stopped them, and there they waited, red-cheeked and panting. Thorne dismounted, throwing his leg over Apple's neck and dropping to catch little Jan in his arms. She squealed as he pulled her away from the horse, erupting with a combination of fury and giggling.

"You brought him home safe?" she asked, wriggling in his arms as she reached for Apple's tack.

"Yes, he's safe," said Thorne, and he deposited her carefully on the saddle; it seemed the best way to prevent disaster. Apple was a calm enough beast when there were no cannon involved, but it didn't do to train the more aggressive instincts out of a warhorse. "Now, be still, or I'll take you down."

The tiny, white-blonde girl bounced in the saddle as though riding at a canter, although Apple ignored her but for a grouchy grunt. "Hey! What happened to his ear?"

The notch at the tip of Apple's right ear was new, but it wasn't a battle wound. The triangular cutting---literally an *earmark*---designated Apple as the private property of his rider, which released the regimental farriers from certain responsibilities regarding the animal should it be killed in combat. For example, when an animal owned by the regiment fell in battle, it fell to the farrier to lop off the beast's hoof in order to prove it had been killed.

"Just a bit of shrapnel," said Thorne. "Nothing we couldn't handle!" Quite frankly, it seemed wiser to let Jan believe that the enemy had done that to her brother's tall, red horse, as opposed to trying to explain why he'd been forced to do it himself.

"Apple is quite a brave horse, isn't he!"

"The very bravest."

Bellesa kept silent. Her mouth twitched when Thorne blamed the enemy for the earmark, but she said nothing. She was much older than their little sister---nearly as old as Thorne himself, though not quite old enough to have been married off yet---and she would understand the reason he had lied.

"The newspapers," said Bellesa as Thorne, Apple, and Jan made their way up the path toward her, "claim that a young trooper distinguished himself quite thoroughly. Didn't our mother make herself clear? She said that you were to do nothing of any particular merit. Nothing whatsoever! Isn't that right, Jan?"

Jan knew enough to agree with her older sister, whatever she said. "Nothing!" she said with a nod.

Thorne's cheeks flared red. "Whatever the papers said, I can assure you that I achieved nothing of note."

Bellesa mistook Thorne's shame for bashful humility, and she hugged him tight. "We're all glad you're home and safe again. I only hope you don't need to leave again too soon."

"The war is over. I should have a little while."

"The war is over, and another is beginning. That is the way of things, after all."

"Another? I hadn't heard."

"Not that kind of war, silly."

"What, then?"

"You'll see."

The head groom met them at the inner gate and took both Apple and Jan to the stables. Bellesa led her brother to where their mother had been painting, on the verandah overlooking the east garden. She smiled at him but did not set aside her brushes; when the muse was upon her, she didn't like to stop.

"It's good you're here," said his mother. "I've been meaning to do your portrait. Can you stand for me?"

"Stand where, Mother?"

"Not now," she said, laughing. "Next week, perhaps. I've been asked to do the princess---the young Countess of Troy?---so it would be nice to have some practice. I've done only landscapes of late."

"Father prefers that, doesn't he?"

Both Bellesa and his mother scowled at his comment. His mother had nurtured a renowned talent over the past nine decades, having picked up painting when she was but a girl. Now she was one of the most sought-after painters in the Empire, but his father, the Lord Thorne, rankled to see her paid for her work. The wife of a Ritter was not meant to work, but to indulge in whatever passions inflamed her.

"You, of all people," said his mother, and she hid her smile, "ought not to concern yourself with what your father prefers."

At last, his mother set aside her brush, and she rose from the saddle, lifting her arms as if to embrace him. Thorne stood forward, ready to be embraced, but he was rebuffed and held at arm's length as she examined him. He dropped his arms to his side and pretended not to be surprised.

"Still no spurt, hm?" she said, her face severe. It was a strange look on one who normally seemed so young and so carefree. "It will come. Soon, I think."

It was strange to hear her talk of his coming growth spurt. He already stood nine leaves in height, which was a goodly height even among the nobility; it was stones he was wanting.

"That is the magic of a portrait," she said, and her mouth took on that same twitch of mischief he'd seen in Bellesa's earlier at the gate before she wrapped him up in a welcoming hug at last. "The painter may paint what she knows rather than what she sees. Now, you've wasted enough time with your mum. The prelate is here, all the way from Wick. He's been waiting all week to see you."

"But, Mother," he began, and he realized with some embarrassment that he did not want to be parted from her again so soon---from her familiar face, her golden curls, and her soft voice. "If he's waited so long, can he not wait another few minutes?"

"Enough of such talk," she scoffed. "And don't let me hear about you questioning his choice, either. The Church's word is law in this house. It always has been."

Thorne's cheeks once more burned as he retreated from the verandah. He always felt embarrassment when he thought of the Church, or of the role it would play in his life. His embarrassment had only been stronger since the winter before, when his father had caught him by the hearth, under a sprig of mistletoe, with the daughter of a prominent merchant.

~ 3676

Lord Thorne had been furious. After the fashion of the upper classes, he had said nothing at all; he went to the butler, whispered a few words, and left the hall. The butler, in the politest possible terms, invited the young lady to leave, and she broke into tears as she ran from the room. The butler shrugged at Thorne, saying, "Ah, the sweet folly of youth."

That night, Thorne and his father shouted at one another for an hour. The next morning, Thorne took Apple and the family sword and rode to muster to join the now-famous Bloody 17th.

The House of Thorne had long held a reputation as one of the most pious families in the Empire. At times, it seemed that piety did them profit; at others, it seemed likely to bring about their ruin instead. Even so, his father's faith in the Church was unshakeable---though, perhaps, that had less to do with faith and more to do with the debts he supposedly owed to the Church.

Thorne went to the chapel, which stood just outside the hedge maze in the east garden. There, at a table in the shade of a grand old tree, the prelate partook of an early lunch of bread, wine, cheeses, what Thorne took to be venison. The prelate was a man with gray hair, a youthful countenance, and an easy sense of authority about him; this authority was buttressed by the presence of a trio of ecclesial wardens who accompanied him.

Each of the wardens wore the brigandine armor of his office, with golden rivets set in rich, crimson leather, and each bore a magnificent longsword, the blade of which was never to be sheathed. Even now, three beautifully etched blades with lustrous gold damask, shone in the sunlight. Both the armor and the weapon of an ecclesial warden were ceremonial, in some sense. Just not in the sense that they weren't also entirely functional.

Ecclesial steel was famous for its keen edge and wondrous toughness. Thorne had been permitted to hold a warden's sword once, in secret. In the sepulcher, in Wick, he held his breath and plucked at the edge of the blade with the pad of his thumb. The sword sang in his hand, vibrating with thirst and with the life hammered into the steel by the smith's craft. To his amazement, red blood welled up from his thumb. Even after all his lessons with the fencing master, he had been entirely unprepared to handle such a sword. Since that day, he had regarded the wardens with awe, and not a little fear.

"Here he is at last!" said the prelate, smiling and rising from his place at the board. "Bishop Driscoll, at your service my young lord. May I say that I have been eagerly awaiting this meeting for some time? And I don't mean simply these past five days."

One of the wardens rose with him, cradling the length of his longsword across his folded arms. The others remained seated, drinking and eating and seemingly amused by their master's formality. That formality, however, was essential for Thorne.

Something in the bishop's voice, or in his smile, made Thorne certain that his pride was being pricked. Of course, to challenge a bishop to a duel was unthinkable, especially in the presence of his wardens; all Thorne could do was to bow low, introduce himself, and smile back. "You have been waiting for this?" he added, genuine curiosity in his voice. "Why?"

"Because now is your lighting day," said the bishop. "Now, we will see what course is set out for the rest of your life."

"Now?"

"Yes, now," said Driscoll, and already he was heading for the chapel. "What better time? You could have been killed off in Untu Buntu; may as well strike while the iron is hot. Or at least before the iron gets deployed once more and is blown to bits, right?"

Church law, as dense and inscrutable as the fog on the Darby, set out the rules by which a man's lighting day was chosen. While a woman's lighting day was usually on or about her sixteenth birthday, a man was not lighted until he was considered, well and truly, a man---usually not before twenty-five, and often much later. Thorne had been dimly aware that war veterans were treated differently to a degree. Until that moment, he had not thought of himself as a veteran at all.

The familiar interior of the chapel was unexpectedly reassuring. Thorne was entering new and undiscovered territory, at once exciting and frightening. He spent some time examining those feelings while pretending to examine the stained glass above the altar: examining a feeling in detail made it easier to pretend that the feeling belonged to someone else, and therefore not to feel it at all.

"Hard to believe your house has survived more than seven hundred years," said Driscoll. He, too, was examining the stained glass.

Thorne wondered if the bishop was able to read the stars in the glass---to calculate, by their positions, the age of the House of Thorne and of the titles held by the Ritter of Dunmar---of if he had simply read that in some book on the peerage. He also wondered if the bishop were deliberately trying to make him angry, but the warden and his golden sword had followed them into the chapel. Thorne chose his words with care.

"We serve at the pleasure of the Imperial household," he said. "We will serve for as long as may be required."

"In point of fact," said Driscoll, "you have served *three* Imperial households. You've held these lands longer than any king, queen, or emperor in living memory. Do you know why that is?"

"Because---"

"Stop," said Driscoll, putting up his hand and wearing a look of disgust. "No answer given that quickly could possibly be well-considered."

"Then why?"

"Never mind." Driscoll approached the altar, along with the white candle waiting there, and the warden took up his post at the entrance. And the exit. "Perhaps, when you are older, you will understand. For now, just know that your house occupies a certain place in the plans of the Church. Are you prepared to do your part?"

Thorne set his jaw and gave a nod. "I am."

The bishop offered him a knife. Thin, sharp as a razor, and damasked with patterns and inscriptions in gold much like the warden's sword, the blade felt heavy in Thorne's hand. Thorne lifted his eyes toward the bishop, weighted down with an unspoken question.

"The palm is traditional," said Driscoll. "Here. Along the life line."

He nodded. He pressed the edge against his palm, and at first he thought it didn't cut. All at once, the blood began to flow, and pain seared him, and he had to remind himself it was only a little cut. That he was a Hussar of the Bloody 17th. That he was a man, and this was his lighting day, and he must not show pain.

Driscoll took him by the wrist and held his dripping hand over the white candle. Red blood ran down its pale flanks, staining the wax and the wick, and Thorne swayed on his feet. The task done, Driscoll pressed a long strip of heavy linen into his hand.

"Wrap it," said Driscoll.

Thorne pulled the linen tight, binding his bleeding palm, and he swallowed. Incense filled his next breath as Driscoll struck a match anointed with sacred oil, and the prelate touched the glowing flame to the blood-bathed wick. The words of a nursery rhyme fluttered through Thorne's head as the chapel spun around him.

<!-- The candle flame burns a different color to represent each caste. White is an ordinary peasant. Gold is a peer. Black is corrupt, meaning that the bloodline must be ended. Red is for the royal bloodlines. -->

> See the taper burning bright
> See the candle set alight
> See the churchman standing near
> See the white flame, have no fear

> Golden, golden, brave and bold
> Golden flames for men of old
> When the wick burns like the sun
> Joyful, joyful, every one

> Gutter gutter, weak and cold
> Dark'ning flames the wicked hold
> Sickness lives within his heart
> Warden, warden, do your part

> Rarest flame, above them all
> Crimson flame to greatness calls
> Snuff the candle, courage take
> Blood of sovereigns must awake

<!-- I'm not married to it. Maybe someone else can come up with something better. -->

Not black. Anything but black. It wouldn't turn black; his family was seven centuries old. Every Thorne had been lighted golden, going all the way back to... He couldn't remember his great, great, great, great grandfather's name. It was something easy to remember. How silly of him. But it couldn't turn black.

White was for peasants. Gold for the peerage. Black for the outcast. Perhaps the flame would turn white; he'd be as good as an outcast then, but he didn't think he'd mind. He could become a fencing master, like old Porinco, with his wide moustache and his bushy brows. He would travel the world, from city to city, teaching noble sons the art of the sword, and they would love and hate him in equal measure, just like old Porinco.

Bishop Driscoll drew in a sharp breath, and Thorne's eyes opened. Their eyes met for an instant---and only for an instant---before Driscoll pinched the wick with the fingers of a gloved hand, snuffing out the candle flame.

Red. The candle had burned blood red.

Still dizzy from the cut on his hand, or perhaps from the sacred incense, Thorne was slow to understand. He raised his hand and the knife, thinking to offer to try again. Red was the wrong color. He didn't notice the quick footsteps behind him, or else he failed to realize their meaning.

Driscoll shouted a warning, but Thorne didn't move. The bishop took him by the collar and slung him across the room, pushing the altar over onto the floor and into the path of the oncoming warden.

Thorne lay sprawled across the stone as the warden sliced the air where Driscoll's head had been only an instant earlier. "It was red," he said. "Not black. It was red."

"He knows that!" said Driscoll, who tried to defend himself with a communion cup. "Why do you think the song said to snuff it out? What are you doing down there? Run!"

The command to run seemed to strike both Thorne and the warden at the same time. Thorne scrambled to his feet as the warden left the bishop and came for him. He slipped, his hobnailed boots gaining no purchase on the polished stone, and he realized that the ecclesial sword would split him like firewood. It would be the cleanest cut he'd ever seen. He cowered, throwing his hands over his head.

No. A gentleman should face death with open eyes.

Thorne had only just decided to lower his hands when a shot rang out and the air filled with the stench of gunpowder. He looked up to see the warden stagger, the magnificent sword slipping from his grasp. The man turned toward the bishop and another deafening blast filled the air with blue smoke, and the sword sang as it fell to the ground.

The other two wardens entered, and Thorne knew what he had to do. He took up the warden's longsword, and he braced himself to face them---and then the prelate shoved him, whacked him with the communion cup.

"Young fool, run!"

Thorne could hardly hear him over the ringing in his ears, but then two more pistol shots echoed thunderously through the chapel. For a moment, Thorne thought it strange that he hadn't seen Driscoll fire, and then he saw the spreading stain on the prelate's jacket, and he looked back to the wardens to see the not-at-all ceremonial revolvers in their hands.

He ran. He threw the sword on the ground and ran. He went out the door behind the altar and, sprinting pell mell, ducked into the hedge maze in the east garden. Another shot burst behind him, muffled by the branches, and the ball tore through the leaves beside him. He looked back just long enough to see the two wardens close behind him, and he ran.

<!-- If I had to guess what's going to happen, it's this: Driscoll will lie and say that the flame was black *to save Thorne's life.* He will then claim that the shootout was a misunderstanding. Thorne will be saved only by his "heroic" acts at Haolien: he has won the Blue and Black, and no man who has been awarded such an honor can be entirely discarded. -->

Some changes to make to the above:

1. Rearrange the scene breaks so that the last scene ends with Thorne running away on his horse and falling off before he can clear the fence on his way out.
2. Maybe go ahead and put the other stuff back in. (parade, drinking, fight, winning the medal...) This scene should basically end act 1/move us into the "magical" world.
3. Thorne is rescued from being put to death by the Grand Duke, who points out that, as a winner of the Blue and Black, he cannot be considered dishonorable. Instead, he is outcast, leaving him outside the protection of the law.
4. The church believes him to be a black flame, meaning they wish to put him to death. The ruling dynasty doesn't necessarily hold the same opinion; they're suspicious, but they dare not go against the Grand Duke, who is the most powerful man in the Empire other than the Emperor himself.
5. The duke is the "pirate" who offered to buy all of Salter's debt, and it is Salter's boat that will carry Thorne and Sergeant Major Patterson to a far-off colony, where the Duke is digging for something very secret.
6. The reason Thorne fell off his horse is that the knife they use for these tests is coated in a kind of narcotic.
