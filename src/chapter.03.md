# Chapter 3

The fall of the heights over Haolien was the beginning of the end. The campaign drew to a close, not with thunder, but with the scratch of pens, and a colony at the edge of civilization changed hands. The crown on the seal on the letters from the governor changed. The destination of the taxes collected and the goods produced changed. For the native peoples of that place, of the Valley of Hell, and of the province of Ul-shann, it meant only that the laws were now written in another language they didn't know.

The boy's brevet appointment was made permanent even before the regiment had withdrawn from the field, but the letter took a month to find him. His father called it a gift for his seventeenth birthday; he had purchased an commission for his son, which was only delayed by confusion at the regimental headquarters. A trooper by that name had already been promoted in the field.

A note from his father accompanied that letter:

> C,

> I trust that you will uphold the best traditions of my house.

> Signed, S

A letter from his mother arrived the week after that, longer, more beautifully written, and impossible to read for the pangs he felt with every word. She spoke of his sisters and their small travails and how he was missed and loved and how she longed for him to be home and safe again and how father wasn't so bad as all that, and she reminded him of his promise to write, letter for letter, just as he had been taught. And so he wrote.

> I am well, Mother. The food is not good, and there is trouble whenever the Foot and Horse meet one another, but it is no great hardship here. I miss our home, and I miss hunting, and I miss the forest behind the house. And I miss Bellesa, and little Jan, too, of course.

> Would you please write to Messrs. Colton and Hobbe for a new uniform jacket? Two would be better. My size has not changed; if anything, I am a little smaller now than I was. My rank, though, has changed. Not through Father's meddling, if you can believe it! Though I know he won't. I am now a lieutenant, though I feel I hardly know how to pack my own meal kit.

> The captain has requested that I be sent to Danes upon our return. He says that a mouth filled with sharp fangs is of no use to an empty head. I believe that amounts to an insult, but I am mindful of my promise to you about dueling. I don't think I will like college. I suppose it can't be worse than war, except in that it will be boring all the time rather than most of the time.

> Love, your Caspian.

To his father, he wrote a more honest letter:

> Father,

> It is my heart's desire never to return to your house, let alone to reflect poorly upon its traditions.

> C

But he did return. With a new uniform jacket, with his new rank, and with his family sword worn at his side, he rode with the 17th Hussars into the capital some four months after the Battle of Haolien. Girls blew kisses and boys saluted in the street, and older gentlemen gave nods of quiet respect to these newly-blooded veterans, and the pretty boy on the pretty horse reflected that his courage had grown in four months: he did not run this time.

Then again, perhaps that was only because, now, there was nowhere to run to.
