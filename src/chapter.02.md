# Chapter 2

That night, the private soldiers of the 51st Rifles would see no Hussar's cup empty, though their own liquor was in short supply. They sang and drank, and they drank and sang, and they danced and embraced like brothers. To see the way they cheered the noble sons of the 17th, one would never know there had been enmity between the Rifles and the Hussars. Thorne's body ached, not from the battle, but from being crushed in the embrace of those veteran soldiers, and from being clapped on the back time and again.

Not because he had begun the charge. No one knew he had begun the charge. There were whispers of a young trooper who had been blown to pink shreds almost before he had passed the trench, but no one knew his name. No; the infantrymen embraced him and clapped his shoulders because he wore the cap of an hussar and a saber swung at his side, and on this one night that was enough.

He had not come through unscathed. Powder had seared him as he charged one of the guns, and he hadn't known it until the battle was done. Someone pointed out the blood dripping from his cuff, and a corporal-of-horse had torn open his jacket, but none of his wounds were larger than a pin-prick; he had been stabbed through in a hundred places, or a thousand, by the powder that burst from the mouth of the cannon. No more.

He felt none of it. He felt only the sweet embrace of life and the heady fog of liquor, not to mention its wondrous burn in his throat, and he wanted never to feel anything else again. He still envied the dead, of which the regiment had nearly three hundred, but now he felt he could wait another day to join them. Or at least one more night.

"That's enough," said a firm voice, well-accustomed to being obeyed, and a gloved hand pulled the bottle from his mouth. Captain Peters, his commanding officer, took the bottle and sat beside him. "Whiskey doesn't wash away pain, but only delays it. It is a coward's unguent."

Thorne's face burned red at those words, and he half rose, reaching for his sword hilt on the blanket beside him. It wasn't there. His protest died on his tongue, robbed of its meaning just as he had been robbed of his blade.

Peters held Thorne's sword in his hand. He drew it from the scabbard, and his lips pursed as he scanned the length of the blade. "Clean," he said. "Well cared for."

"It is my only precious thing," said Thorne, his words slurred by drink.

"Life is the only precious thing."

"I despise life!"

"Perhaps you do," said Peters. He turned the blade, and in the firelight he seemed to be examining the motto etched into the steel. He removed his glove and scraped at the letters with a fingernail, then drew his finger away to examine it. "Whose blood is this, Mr. Thorne?"

"How should I know?"

"Is it yours?"

Thorne laughed---a sound like a puppy being stabbed. He fell onto his side and lay there, laughing, never knowing the joke. "There was a gun captain," he said. "And his loaders. And the man at the trigger. There were men hauling shells. There was one pointing a rifle at me. It's their blood. It's all of their blood. The stains on the grip are mine."

<!-- Clarify that Thorne killed these people. -->

The captain nodded. Then he said, "It's good you weren't too thorough in your cleaning, Mr. Thorne. I might have mistaken you for a coward."

Fear raced through him again. The greater of two fears: fear of being un-manned rather than merely un-made. Even the whiskey could not silence that fear. "I'm not," he whispered. "I would sooner die."

"Be that as it may," said Captain Peters, "there is a rumor that the man who broke and started that... That strangely fortunate stroke of misfortune... That he was an ordinary trooper, much like yourself. Young, slight of build, and impetuous. As they say, a pretty boy on a pretty horse."

Thorne swallowed, or would have. His mouth had become too dry.

"It would be unfortunate," said Peters, "if anyone were to mistake you for him. If he is ever found out, you see, he will be hanged by the neck until dead."

The boy said nothing. The pretty boy with the pretty horse surprised himself by feeling nothing at this pronouncement. To be dead was to be dead, and to have known the end of fear. A strange sense of peace came over him at the thought, and he was silent.

Captain Peters threw something at him in the half-dark of the firelight, and Thorne saw that it was a uniform jacket, bloodied and torn. It had belonged to a lieutenant, for it carried a lieutenant's markings.

"You, hereby, are my lieutenant by brevet," said Peters. "Lose your old jacket. And, if anyone asks, you've a lieutenant's pay to go with your lieutenant's bars. To ensure that no mistakes are made."

"Yes, sir." Thorne pushed his arm into the blood-stiff sleeve, and he fumbled drunkenly at the buttons. "Sir?"

"War is an uglier thing now," said the captain, "than it was in the days of my youth. For that, I would give you another chance. Never speak of it."

"Yes, sir."

The captain returned his sword and arose. That night, Thorne slept until the whiskey left him, and he awoke trembling before morning.
