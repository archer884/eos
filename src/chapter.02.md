# Chapter 2

(Reworking.)

Horses and horse's asses and horse shit clogged the high street for the better part of an hour, right at the middle of midday, when common folk had things to do and places to be. Oh, it was a pretty enough parade, to be sure, with bands playing and banners dancing in the breeze, but couldn't they have picked tomorrow? Why today, of all days? Why today, when Salter had just put into port?

"Relax," muttered Gramble, his ship's master. "Wouldn't kill you to cheer. Say God save the Queen, just once? If the almighty won't save her, he's not looking out for you, I can tell you."

"No, I won't," said Salter. "These poffs think we've nothing better to do than wait hand and foot on them. It's preposterous!"

Gramble heaved a longsuffering sigh, but Salter noticed the way he rolled his eyes: to Gramble, Salter was probably just one short step removed from those poffs he railed against. Salter pursed his lips and looked away. It was true that the merchant class could hardly be compared to common laborers, but his family had come by its fortune by good, honest trading, if not by a good, honest trade.

<!-- "Salter" is an occupational name for one who sells salt. -->

"It'll be over soon," said Gramble, nodding toward the parade. "See there? The 17th Hussars. They'll have the honor of riding last today. Covered them-damn-selves in glory at Holler Valley, or some such."

"A likely story," sniffed Salter. "They probably arrived just in time to take credit after the infantry bore the brunt of the fighting."

"Begging your pardon, sir," said Gramble, "but you'll be wanting to belay that kind of talk. I know you fancy yourself one of the lads, but here...." Gramble left the sentence unfinished, perhaps afraid of giving offense.

"Here what, Mr. Gramble?"

"Well, you're not so different from them, are you?"

"Mr. Gramble, I'm surprised at you. You know me to be a fair man, and sincere, and that I believe firmly in the equality of all."

"Of course you do, sir," said Gramble, "but there's the rub. If you and them are equal, you're subject to their code of honor. A wharf rat like me can speak as he likes, but a gentlemanly fellow like yourself should watch his tongue."

"Ah. I see."

The 17th Hussars passed by: handsome, young men, all members of the nobility, of one stripe or another, and all mounted on tall, beautiful horses. He had seen such regiments on parade a dozen times or more, but not quite like this. The 17th Hussars were bloodied by a recent fight; their wounds had healed, but scars remained. The signs were visible for one who cared to look: in the livid weal on one man's face, or in another's missing arm. And yet that wasn't the worst of it.

Salter, throughout his life, was accustomed to seeing the Queen's cavalry regiments on parade at their full, authorized strength of four squadrons, or more than seven hundred men. Somehow, the 17th had been reduced from four squadrons to only two. The regiment had lost nearly fifty percent of its strength in one battle.

"Paper said these lads gave the Carolingians hell," said Grambler, and the barrel-chested seaman pressed his fist to his heart in salute as they went by. "God save the Queen," he called, his voice roaring out with the rest of the crowd, "and God have mercy on him who stands before the Hussars!"

At Grambler's cry, the Hussars drew their swords and cheered in reply, spirited young men on hot-blooded horses. One great, smoke gray gelding reared up as though on command, and its rider shouted, "May God have mercy, for we have none!"

The sound of drums and and bugles began to swell until their fury caused Salter's ribs to clatter against one another, and even the cheering roar of the crowd was drowned out as the 17th Hussars began their regimental song. They began with the third verse---being the *return,* while each regiment's song began with first a *levy,* then a *parting*---and repeated only that verse as they marched, their horses stamping proudly as they went. It was as if they did not know fully half their brothers in arms lay cold in the earth of some foreign land.

Salter shivered when they had gone.

Grambler gave him a curious look.

"Well?" said Salter. "Come on, then!"

First the stock exchange, where he would secure the sale of his goods. His good which, as a matter of course, included several tons of salt, which meant that the very next thing he would do would be to bear with good grace the ribbing that would naturally follow. It wasn't *his* salt; his surname hadn't been literally true in three generations. After that, he would purchase bulk goods for the next leg of the trip, down to southern colonies, and he would lay in a good stock of supply for the journey in case he and his crew needed to winter there.

Grambler pressed a newspaper into his hand, interrupting his thoughts.

"What is this? I don't want this."

"Read."

"Heroic 17th returns home," he said, frowning at the headline.

"Not that."

"Lieutenant mentioned in dispatches?"

"No."

"Second naval law passed?"

"Damn it, here!" Gramble planted a thick, calloused finger on the page, all the way at the bottom.

"Ul-shann opened to trade," said Salter. "Well, I don't see how that matters. Perhaps next year we can make a trip there for... For...."

For salt. For countless tons of precious, perfect, pure salt. For salt that would normally take months to dry and grade, to clean and collect, and to ship from the horse latitudes back to civilization. For more salt than any man in the empire knew what to do with. The first shipments from Ul-shann would be arriving in days, if they hadn't already.

Salter broke into a run, hurtling breakneck through the streets, bouncing from shop to corner and from corner to shop, overturning carts and old women and apologizing only in breathless passing. He ran, clutching his manifest to his chest, and he prayed.

He was too late.

The price of salt, the bulk of his cargo, had already fallen from six crowns and twelve to just twelve---hardly any more than he had paid to begin with. The air felt close. His collar was too tight. His stomach roiled and he panted, sweating.

"Salt, right?" asked a man with a cocked hat and a twinkling smile.

Salter nodded. For a moment, he wondered how the man knew. Only for a moment.

"Let's just have a look," said the man, who took Salter's manifest and whistled at what he saw on the page. "Oh, my. My, my, my... Tsk. You have made a poor wager, haven't you."

"I---I have."

Soon, he would have no worries of being mistaken for a gentleman. He would be able to speak his mind as freely as Grambler, and no one would take offense, because no one would care what he said. He wouldn't even have the old family business to fall back on. Not unless something happened to close the mines again. Perhaps he could blow them up. He laughed as the man with the twinkling smile tut-tutted at him.

"And yet you are in luck," said the man. "I represent Mayben, Jennings, and Roth, and I am prepared to offer you three crowns and six for the balance of your stores."

"What? Three... Three *crowns?"*

Half price. Certainly, it was only half price, but it was more than five times what he might have gotten in an honest sale---and yet that very thought troubled him. An *honest* sale: which made this *dishonest,* didn't it?

"Why three crowns?"

"Three crowns and six, my good man," said the man with the twinkling, well-practiced smile, "because it is the opinion of Messrs Mayben, Jennings, and Roth that the empire cannot do without adventuresome businessmen like yourself. Consider the price as a small investment in the future of the realm."

The man smiled and put out his hand, but Salter didn't take it.

"Join me for a drink," said the man. "We'll discuss the particulars over an ale. That, at least, must be amenable?"

Just then, Grambler caught up in time to see Salter headed for the nearest pub in the company of the unnamed man with the twinkling, lying smile. Grambler shot him a dour look, and Salter shrugged. He shrugged, and he went for drinks with the pirate.

~

A regiment's song had three verses: the levy, the parting, and the return. There was no verse for battle, for that part was sung by hard, ringing steel, the booming voice of guns, and the rattle of rifle fire; by the scream of horses and the dying and the damned; by the silence that ruled when the armies had gone. The silence of the grave, broken only by the cries of carrion birds wheeling in the blue sky.

There was, however, a fourth verse.

Each regiment's fourth verse, the Long Verse, was known only to the members of the regiment. When it was sung---if ever it was sung---it was only on the way to battle. That verse consisted of the names of the regiment's fallen. For the 17th Hussars, the Long Verse began with the Battle of Hoarfront, with the names of Andrew Marlbrew, William Easton, Samuel Atick, and Earnest Pettigrew. Four Hussars had fallen on the Hoarfront, in the first combat listed among the regiment's battle honors, and their sacrifice had begun the Long Verse.

In nearly one hundred years of service to the Atlantean Empire, that verse had grown to only two hundred and fourteen names. In a single day---one, black day in Haolien---that verse had more than doubled in length, to four hundred and eighty-two names.

Newspapers sang the praises of the light regiment and its dauntless courage. The 17th Hussars had not only charged the guns on the heights of Haolien: they had charged into history and left their bloody mark on the proud annals of the Army. One too-pragmatic commentator had condemned Colonel Augustus Finch for his handling of the regiment, and the question had been raised in parliament, but all such condemnation had been shouted down. Besides, the colonel had not been at fault.

All of that blood was on Thorne's hands.

All those pretty boys. Eighteen, nineteen, perhaps twenty-one years of age. Most of them still unmarried. All of them with mothers who wrote them to say how they hoped their sons would return soon, and safe, and whose fathers perhaps loved them, even if they could not say it. Boys with brothers and sisters who mourned them even while pretending to be proud. Boys with sweethearts left lonely, with dreams shattered by shellfire, cut down by rifle bullets, torn asunder by the violence of war.

As the Hussars marched in parade, and as they sang the return, Thorne foundered in the midst of the gravity of his mistake. His throat closed up, and only his mount's long-trained habits kept him in his proper place in the formation. He had never been so glad for the end of a parade---once his favorite part of being in the army. When the formation was dismissed, he knew just where he would go.

"Ho, there, Lieutenant!" shouted one of his fellows, a lad called Mitchell by his comrades.

Thorne gave no answer, and Mitchell caught him up quickly, as Thorne lacked the heart to gallop. The pale young man slapped his back as he came alongside.

"You're not already too good to drink with the men, are you?" asked Mitchell, grinning from ear to ear.

"What makes you think I want a drink?"

"Well, it's nearly noon, and what else have you done lately?"

Part of the cavalry's reputation for indiscipline stemmed from this: the comparative familiarity between officers and men. Even ordinary troopers of the cavalry were, after all, usually of noble birth; they didn't think of their officers as being cut from different cloth, unlike the men of the Rifles or the Foot. Thorne had never minded that until now.

Another trooper, this one named Barclay, rode up beside them as they wound through the narrow side street. These three had entered in the same levy---though they had once been seven in number. The Immortal Seven, as Harvey Donne had been wont to say.

Donne had survived the charge but taken shrapnel through both lungs. By sheer audacity, or through foolish pride, he had reached the heights and seen the Carolingians put to rout before he fell from the saddle. Naively, Thorne first mistook the chalky pallor of his face for actual chalk before realizing that his friend had been bled completely white.

"You, at least," he said as he lay dying, "are still immortal. Give my sister a kiss from me?"

Thorne did not know where the others had fallen, but he knew that much of the newest levy had fared poorly in the battle. They had much to learn of being shot at and only scant seconds to learn it. Given their blistering baptism of fire, perhaps it was surprising that only four of the Immortal Seven had been killed in action.

"Not again," said Barclay. "Not so early in the day."

"It's guilt," said Mitchell. "Did you see him in action?"

"No, but I heard he cut down a dozen."

"A dozen be damned. It was a full score---and I watched with my own eyes!"

"There's nothing to be ashamed of, Caz," said Barclay, "and that's the truth of it. They were fighting men every one. You did what any gentleman ought to do. It is no sin to slay the enemy in the midst of action."

"He's right," said Mitchell. "I only wish I had managed to get stuck in before they fled. That animal of yours is magnificent. I've never seen one faster! Although, I suppose it's possible you just weigh less than the rest of us. What about you, Bark? Did you get one?"

"I crossed swords with a grenadier," said Barclay, "or maybe that was his bayonet, but my horse carried me past before we could conclude our business. Captain Peters gutted one. Oh, it was a dreadful sight!"

"Anyway, you should feel proud. I'm told you've been gazetted. Everyone will know you're a hero!"

Proud? Hero? Proud of what? Of heroically getting half his regiment killed? Thorne pulled at the visor of his cap, and he sat straighter in the saddle. "I just realized," he said, keeping his voice blank and unreadable, "I forgot something."
