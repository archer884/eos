# Chapter 4

Horses and horse's asses and horse shit clogged the high street for the better part of an hour, right at the middle of midday, when common folk had things to do and places to be. Oh, it was a pretty enough parade, to be sure, with bands playing and banners dancing in the breeze, but couldn't they have picked tomorrow? Why today, of all days? Why today, when Salter had just put into port?

"Relax," muttered Gramble, his ship's master. "Wouldn't kill you to cheer. Say God save the Queen, just once? If the almighty won't save her, he's not looking out for you, I can tell you."

"No, I won't," said Salter. "These poffs think we've nothing better to do than wait hand and foot on them. It's preposterous!"

Gramble heaved a longsuffering sigh, but Salter noticed the way he rolled his eyes: to Gramble, Salter was probably just one short step removed from those poffs he railed against. Salter pursed his lips and looked away. It was true that the merchant class could hardly be compared to common laborers, but his family had come by its fortune by good, honest trading, if not by a good, honest trade.

<!-- "Salter" is an occupational name for one who sells salt. -->

"It'll be over soon," said Gramble, nodding toward the parade. "See there? The 17th Hussars. They'll have the honor of riding last today. Covered them-damn-selves in glory at Holler Valley, or some such."

"A likely story," sniffed Salter. "They probably arrived just in time to take credit after the infantry bore the brunt of the fighting."

"Begging your pardon, sir," said Gramble, "but you'll be wanting to belay that kind of talk. I know you fancy yourself one of the lads, but here...." Gramble left the sentence unfinished, perhaps afraid of giving offense.

"Here what, Mr. Gramble?"

"Well, you're not so different from them, are you?"

"Mr. Gramble, I'm surprised at you. You know me to be a fair man, and sincere, and that I believe firmly in the equality of all."

"Of course you do, sir," said Gramble, "but there's the rub. If you and them are equal, you're subject to their code of honor. A wharf rat like me can speak as he likes, but a gentlemanly fellow like yourself should watch his tongue."

"Ah. I see."

The 17th Hussars passed by: handsome, young men, all members of the nobility, of one stripe or another, and all mounted on tall, beautiful horses. He had seen such regiments on parade a dozen times or more, but not quite like this. The 17th Hussars were bloodied by a recent fight; their wounds had healed, but scars remained. The signs were visible for one who cared to look: in the livid weal on one man's face, or in another's missing arm. And yet that wasn't the worst of it.

Salter, throughout his life, was accustomed to seeing the Queen's cavalry regiments on parade at their full, authorized strength of four squadrons, or more than seven hundred men. Somehow, the 17th had been reduced from four squadrons to only two. The regiment had lost nearly fifty percent of its strength in one battle.

"Paper said these lads gave the Carolingians hell," said Gramble, and the barrel-chested seaman pressed his fist to his heart in salute as they went by. "God save the Queen," he called, his voice roaring out with the rest of the crowd, "and God have mercy on him who stands before the Hussars!"

At Gramble's cry, the Hussars drew their swords and cheered in reply, spirited young men on hot-blooded horses. One great, smoke gray gelding reared up as though on command, and its rider shouted, "May God have mercy, for we have none!"

The sound of drums and and bugles began to swell until their fury caused Salter's ribs to clatter against one another, and even the cheering roar of the crowd was drowned out as the 17th Hussars began their regimental song. They began with the third verse---being the *return,* while each regiment's song began with first a *levy,* then a *parting*---and repeated only that verse as they marched, their horses stamping proudly as they went. It was as if they did not know fully half their brothers in arms lay cold in the earth of some foreign land.

Salter shivered when they had gone.

Gramble gave him a curious look.

"Well?" said Salter. "Come on, then!"

First the stock exchange, where he would secure the sale of his goods. His good which, as a matter of course, included several tons of salt, which meant that the very next thing he would do would be to bear with good grace the ribbing that would naturally follow. It wasn't *his* salt; his surname hadn't been literally true in three generations. After that, he would purchase bulk goods for the next leg of the trip, down to southern colonies, and he would lay in a good stock of supply for the journey in case he and his crew needed to winter there.

Gramble pressed a newspaper into his hand, interrupting his thoughts.

"What is this? I don't want this."

"Read."

"Heroic 17th returns home," he said, frowning at the headline.

"Not that."

"Lieutenant mentioned in dispatches?"

"No."

"Second naval law passed?"

"Damn it, here!" Gramble planted a thick, calloused finger on the page, all the way at the bottom.

"Ul-shann opened to trade," said Salter. "Well, I don't see how that matters. Perhaps next year we can make a trip there for... For...."

For salt. For countless tons of precious, perfect, pure salt. For salt that would normally take months to dry and grade, to clean and collect, and to ship from the horse latitudes back to civilization. For more salt than any man in the empire knew what to do with. The first shipments from Ul-shann would be arriving in days, if they hadn't already.

Salter broke into a run, hurtling breakneck through the streets, bouncing from shop to corner and from corner to shop, overturning carts and old women and apologizing only in breathless passing. He ran, clutching his manifest to his chest, and he prayed.

He was too late.

The price of salt, the bulk of his cargo, had already fallen from six crowns and twelve to just twelve---hardly any more than he had paid to begin with. The air felt close. His collar was too tight. His stomach roiled and he panted, sweating.

"Salt, right?" asked a man with a cocked hat and a twinkling smile.

Salter nodded. For a moment, he wondered how the man knew. Only for a moment.

"Let's just have a look," said the man, who took Salter's manifest and whistled at what he saw on the page. "Oh, my. My, my, my... Tsk. You have made a poor wager, haven't you."

"I---I have."

Soon, he would have no worries of being mistaken for a gentleman. He would be able to speak his mind as freely as Gramble, and no one would take offense, because no one would care what he said. He wouldn't even have the old family business to fall back on. Not unless something happened to close the mines again. Perhaps he could blow them up. He laughed as the man with the twinkling smile tut-tutted at him.

"And yet you are in luck," said the man. "I represent Mayben, Jennings, and Roth, and I am prepared to offer you three crowns and six for the balance of your stores."

"What? Three... Three *crowns?"*

Half price. Certainly, it was only half price, but it was more than five times what he might have gotten in an honest sale---and yet that very thought troubled him. An *honest* sale: which made this *dishonest,* didn't it?

"Why three crowns?"

"Three crowns and six, my good man," said the man with the twinkling, well-practiced smile, "because it is the opinion of Messrs Mayben, Jennings, and Roth that the empire cannot do without adventuresome businessmen like yourself. Consider the price as a small investment in the future of the realm."

The man smiled and put out his hand, but Salter didn't take it.

"Join me for a drink," said the man. "We'll discuss the particulars over an ale. That, at least, must be amenable?"

Just then, Gramble caught up in time to see Salter headed for the nearest pub in the company of the unnamed man with the twinkling, lying smile. Gramble shot him a dour look, and Salter shrugged. He shrugged, and he went for drinks with the pirate.
