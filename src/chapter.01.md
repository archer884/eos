# Chapter 1

Thunder echoed from the far ridge: the report of cannon, and the burst of shellfire. Smoke, drifting from the gun pits cut in the sticky chalk of the Haolien Valley, stung the eyes and caught in the throat. A faint flash and a glut of gray smoke was the only sign as the guns on the heights made reply, sending their metal rain back into the valley to tear new craters in the chalk, and to tear men asunder.

Cries rang out, sharp and rending, and clods of earth fell across the shallow trenches of Her Majesty's Own 51st Rifles. This Hell was theirs, and had been theirs alone for three days. Now, without water, short on ammunition, and shelled to ribbons, they were ready to break. Now the hammer would fall. Now, into this Hell, the 17th Hussars marched.

Pretty boys on pretty horses. Oh, how they shine!

Do they know which end of a shovel goes into the earth?

Don't be cross, lads. The battle is over. Don't you see? The Gray Goats would never risk so many noble sons.

Oh, but they would. Easier to risk noble sons, because noble sons lacked the courage to flee in the face of the enemy. A private soldier might turn and run, break and save himself, but a baron's boy? It would be suicide. Better to die than to face that shame: better to be un-made than un-manned, and to be cast out from all he had known. So it was that the pretty boy on the pretty horse was caught between two fears, and those fears warred to see which was the greater.

His name was Thorne. His sword, etched with the family's most ancient motto, declared *Vincere Vel Mori*---Conquer or Die---and his hand clenched at its hilt so that none could see he was shaking. Yesterday, he had been without fear. Yesterday, the 17th had marched past an abandoned trench.

The boy, only sixteen, could not forget the stench of death. It stuck in his nostrils and clawed at his mind. He could not forget the sight of bloated, sun-baked corpses, or of the flies and their maggots crawling on sightless, yellowed eyes. He could not forget the plaintive cry of a mangled man pleading for water.

Water or death.

Victory or death.

The boy could accept victory or death. He could embrace either, openly, gladly, with joy in his heart, but to spend days in a trench waiting and praying for death to come... Captain Peters had shot the man through the head with a pistol, at last granting him relief, but that same relief had not been granted to the boy named Thorne.

Yesterday, the 17th had been issued breach-loading rifles and cartridge belts. Even now, a heavy, brown box pressed painfully into the boy's side, laden with .464 caliber rounds, and the weight of a rifle sling bore down on his narrow shoulder. He could shoot. He had learned to hunt as soon as he had learned to ride, and he had learned to ride almost before he could walk, but the rifle was not a gentleman's weapon. It was crude, and heavy, and stank of tar and rotted eggs, and it represented a coward's way of war. Could they not meet the enemy face to face?

He would gladly meet the enemy! Let him stand nose to nose, blade to blade, and test himself. Let him go out and bleed and die, or kill and conquer, whatever the cost, but do not ask him to dig his own grave and lie in it and wait for the end. For a merciful bullet through the head. For the sappers to cover him over.

"Hussars, prepare to dismount!"

Apple, the boy's pretty, dark horse, quivered beneath him. The beast felt the thunderous voice of the cannon on the heights through its very hooves, even before the shell had come. An instant later, fragments of scorched and twisted metal pierced the very air, singeing clothing and shredding flesh: the shell had fallen short, activating its fuse as it glanced off the earth, and it burst in the air as it passed by the Hussars. A perfect shot.

Blood gushed, shooting across the white chalk from the throat of the man before him. How lucky that man was, to receive a certain death, quick and painless! Thorne would have cried out but for the heart that pounded in his own throat, and Apple shifted uneasily beneath him, responding to his fear.

And then there was a cry: a wordless, primal scream of impotent rage and fear. There was a cry, accompanied by the silent whisper of steel as his family sword sprang from the scabbard, and only as the blade rose up, blazing under the harsh blue sky, did Thorne realize that cry was his. He shrugged off the weight of the rifle on his shoulder, threw down his cartridge box, and he broke from the regiment.

He ran. He was running. Without orders. Against orders. But he was not a coward. Never let it be said that he ran from the enemy, or that he feared death. Let them say that he sought death with greater sincerity, with more eagerness, than others.

Apple sailed across the shallow trench and his hooves tore chalk from the earth, and Thorne galloped toward the heights with his sword raised. The next shell only just missed him, skipping off the earth a few feet to the right of him. It detonated just behind him, deafening him as it showered the regiment with more shrapnel. Blinded by the spray of chalk from the glancing shell, he rode on, trusting his mount to run toward battle and the thunder of guns. He and his red horse were alike in their breeding.

Not until tears had bled the chalk from his eyes did Thorne realize that he was not alone. The regiment rode with him. Perhaps they thought an order had been given, or perhaps all control had been lost. Noble sons, like their horses, are spirited beasts, and given to eagerness. The thunder of guns and hooves filled the valley below the heights, and the Hussars rode into the mouth of Hell.

That night, the private soldiers of the 51st Rifles would see no Hussar's cup empty, though their own liquor was in short supply. They sang and drank, and they drank and sang, and they danced and embraced like brothers. To see the way they cheered the noble sons of the 17th, one would never know there had been enmity between the Rifles and the Hussars. Thorne's body ached, not from the battle, but from being crushed in the embrace of those veteran soldiers, and from being clapped on the back time and again.

Not because he had begun the charge. No one knew he had begun the charge. There were whispers of a young cornet who had been blown to pink shreds almost before he had passed the trench, but no one knew his name. No; the infantrymen embraced him and clapped his shoulders because he wore the cap of an hussar and a saber swung at his side, and on this one night that was enough.

He had not come through unscathed. Powder had seared him as he charged one of the guns, and he hadn't known it until the battle was done. Someone pointed out the blood dripping from his cuff, and a corporal-of-horse had torn open his jacket, but none of his wounds were larger than a pin-prick; he had been stabbed through in a hundred places, or a thousand, by the powder that burst from the mouth of the cannon. No more.

He felt none of it. He felt only the sweet embrace of life and the heady fog of liquor, not to mention its wondrous burn in his throat, and he never wanted to feel anything else again. He still envied the dead, of which the regiment had nearly three hundred, but now he felt he could wait another day to join them. Or at least one more night.

"That's enough," said a firm voice, well-accustomed to being obeyed, and a gloved hand pulled the bottle from his mouth. Captain Peters, his commanding officer, took the bottle and sat beside him. "Whiskey doesn't wash away pain, but only delays it. It is a coward's unguent."

Thorne's face burned red at those words, and he half rose, reaching for his sword hilt on the blanket beside him. It wasn't there. His protest died on his tongue, robbed of its meaning just as he had been robbed of his blade.

Peters held Thorne's sword in his hand. He drew it from the scabbard, and his lips pursed as he scanned the length of the blade. "Clean," he said. "Well cared for."

"It is my only precious thing," said Thorne, his words slurred by drink.

"Life is the only precious thing."

"I despise life!"

"Perhaps you do," said Peters. He turned the blade, and in the firelight he seemed to be examining the motto etched into the steel. He removed his glove and scraped at the letters with a fingernail, then drew his finger away to examine it. "Whose blood is this, Cornet Thorne?"

"How should I know?"

"Is it yours?"

Thorne laughed---a sound like a puppy being stabbed. He fell onto his side and lay there, laughing, never knowing the joke. "There was a gun captain," he said. "And his loaders. And the man at the trigger. There were men hauling shells. There was one pointing a rifle at me. It's their blood. It's all of their blood. The stains on the grip are mine."

The captain nodded. Then he said, "It's good you weren't too thorough in your cleaning, Mr. Thorne. I might have mistaken you for a coward."

Fear raced through him again. The greater of two fears: fear of being un-manned rather than merely un-made. Even the whiskey could not silence that fear. "I'm not," he whispered. "I would sooner die."

"Be that as it may," said Captain Peters, "there is a rumor that the man who broke and started that... That strangely fortunate stroke of misfortune... That he was a cornet, much like yourself. Young and impetuous. As they say, a pretty boy on a pretty horse."

Thorne swallowed, or would have. His mouth had become too dry.

"It would be unfortunate," said Peters, "if anyone were to mistake you for him. If he is ever found out, you see, he will be hanged by the neck until dead."

The boy said nothing. The pretty boy with the pretty horse surprised himself by feeling nothing at this pronouncement. To be dead was to be dead, and to have known the end of fear. A strange sense of peace came over him at the thought, and he was silent.

Captain Peters threw something at him in the half-dark of the firelight, and Thorne saw that it was a uniform jacket, bloodied and torn. It had belonged to a lieutenant, for it carried a lieutenant's markings.

"You, hereby, are my lieutenant by brevet," said Peters. "Lose your old jacket. And, if anyone asks, you've a lieutenant's pay to go with your lieutenant's bars. To ensure that no mistakes are made."

"Yes, sir." Thorne pushed his arm into the blood-stiff sleeve, and he fumbled drunkenly at the buttons. "Sir?"

"War is an uglier thing now," said the captain, "than it was in the days of my youth. For that, I would give you another chance. Never speak of it."

"Yes, sir."

The captain returned his sword and arose. That night, Thorne slept until the whiskey left him, and he awoke trembling before morning.

The fall of the heights over Haolien was the beginning of the end. The campaign drew to a close, not with thunder, but with the scratch of pens, and a colony at the edge of civilization changed hands. The crown on the seal on the letters from the governor changed. The destination of the taxes collected and the goods produced changed. For the native peoples of that place, of the Valley of Hell, and of the province of Ul-shann, it meant only that the laws were now written in another language they didn't know.

The boy's brevet appointment was made permanent even before the regiment had withdrawn from the field, but the letter took a month to find him. His father called it a gift for his seventeenth birthday; he had purchased an increase in rank which was only delayed by confusion at the regimental headquarters. A cornet by that name had already been promoted, for extreme valor in trying circumstances.

A note from his father accompanied that letter:

> C,

> I trust that you will uphold the best traditions of my house.

> Signed, S

A letter from his mother arrived the week after that, longer, more beautifully written, and impossible to read for the pangs he felt with every word. She spoke of his sisters and their small travails and how he was missed and loved and how she longed for him to be home and safe again and how father wasn't so bad as all that, and she reminded him of his promise to write, letter for letter, just as he had been taught. And so he wrote.

> I am well, Mother. The food is not good, and there is trouble whenever the Foot and Horse meet one another, but it is no great hardship here. I miss our home, and I miss hunting, and I miss the forest behind the house. And I miss Bellesa, and little Jan, too, of course.

> Would you please write to Messrs. Colton and Hobbe for a new uniform jacket? Two would be better. My size has not changed; if anything, I am a little smaller now than I was. My rank, though, has changed. Not through Father's meddling, if you can believe it! Though I know he won't. I am now a lieutenant, though I feel I hardly know how to pack my own meal kit.

> The captain has requested that I be sent to Danes upon our return. He says that a mouth filled with sharp fangs is of no use to an empty head. I believe that amounts to an insult, but I am mindful of my promise to you about dueling. I don't think I will like college. I suppose it can't be worse than war, except in that it will be boring all the time rather than most of the time.

> Love, your Caspian.

To his father, he wrote a more honest letter:

> Father,

> It is my heart's desire never to return to your house, let alone to reflect poorly upon its traditions.

> C

But he did return. With a new uniform jacket, with his new rank, and with his family sword worn at his side, he rode with the 17th Hussars into the capital some four months after the Battle of Haolien. Girls blew kisses and boys saluted in the street, and older gentlemen gave nods of quiet respect to these newly-blooded veterans, and the pretty boy on the pretty horse reflected that his courage had grown in four months: he did not run this time.

Then again, perhaps that was only because now there was nowhere to run to.
