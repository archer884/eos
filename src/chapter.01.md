# Chapter 1

Thunder echoed from the far ridge: the report of cannon, and the burst of shellfire. Smoke, drifting from the gun pits cut in the sticky chalk of the Haolien Valley, stung the eyes and caught in the throat. A faint flash and a glut of gray smoke was the only sign as the guns on the heights made reply, sending their metal rain back into the valley to tear new craters in the chalk, and to tear men asunder.

Cries rang out, sharp and rending, and clods of earth fell across the shallow trenches of Her Majesty's Own 51st Rifles. This Hell was theirs, and had been theirs alone for three days. Now, without water, short on ammunition, and shelled to ribbons, they were ready to break. Now the hammer would fall. Now, into this Hell, rode the 17th Hussars.

Pretty boys on pretty horses. Oh, how they shine!

Do they know which end of a shovel goes into the earth?

Don't be cross, lads. The battle is over. Don't you see? The Gray Goats would never risk so many noble sons.

Oh, but they would. Easier to risk noble sons, because noble sons lacked the courage to flee in the face of the enemy. A private soldier might turn and run, break and save himself, but a baron's boy? It would be suicide. Better to die than to face that shame: better to be un-made than un-manned, and to be cast out from all he had known. So it was that the pretty boy on the pretty horse was caught between two fears, and those fears warred to see which was the greater.

His name was Thorne. His sword, etched with the family's most ancient motto, declared *Vincere Vel Mori*---Conquer or Die---and his hand clenched at its hilt so that none could see he was shaking. Yesterday, he had been without fear. Yesterday, the 17th had marched past an abandoned trench.

The boy, only sixteen, could not forget the stench of death. It stuck in his nostrils and clawed at his mind. He could not forget the sight of bloated, sun-baked corpses, or of the flies and their maggots crawling on sightless, yellowed eyes. He could not forget the plaintive cry of a mangled man pleading for water.

Water or death.

Victory or death.

The boy could accept victory or death. He could embrace either, openly, gladly, with joy in his heart, but to spend days in a trench waiting and praying for death to come... Captain Peters had shot the man through the head with a pistol, at last granting him relief, but that same relief had not been granted to the boy named Thorne.

Yesterday, the 17th had been issued breach-loading rifles and cartridge belts. Even now, a heavy, brown box pressed painfully into the boy's side, laden with .464 caliber rounds, and the weight of a rifle sling bore down on his narrow shoulder. He could shoot. He had learned to hunt as soon as he had learned to ride, and he had learned to ride almost before he could walk, but the rifle was not a gentleman's weapon. It was crude, and heavy, and stank of tar and rotted eggs, and it represented a coward's way of war. Could they not meet the enemy face to face?

Oh, how glad he would be to meet the enemy! Let him stand nose to nose, blade to blade, and be tested. Let him go out and bleed and die, or kill and conquer, whatever the result, but do not ask him to dig his own grave and lie in it and wait for the end.

For a merciful bullet through the head.

For the sun to bleach and bloat his corpse.

For the sappers to cover him over.

"Hussars, prepare to dismount!"

Apple, the boy's pretty horse, quivered beneath him. The beast felt the thunderous voice of the cannon on the heights through its very hooves, even before the shell had come. An instant later, fragments of scorched and twisted metal pierced the very air, singeing clothing and shredding flesh: the shell had fallen short, activating its fuse as it glanced off the earth, and it burst in the air as it passed by the Hussars. A perfect shot.

Blood gushed, shooting across the white chalk from the throat of the man before him. How lucky that man was, to receive a certain death, quick and painless! Thorne would have cried out but for the heart that pounded in his own throat, and Apple shifted uneasily beneath him, responding to his fear.

And then there was a cry: a wordless, primal scream of impotent rage and fear. There was a cry, accompanied by the silent whisper of steel as his family sword sprang from the scabbard, and only as the blade rose up, blazing under the harsh blue sky, did Thorne realize that cry was his. He shrugged off the weight of the rifle on his shoulder, threw down his cartridge box, and he broke from the regiment.

He ran. He was running. Without orders. Against orders. But he was not a coward. Never let it be said that he ran from the enemy, or that he feared death. Let them say that he sought death with greater sincerity, with more eagerness, than others.

<!-- Change "He ran. He was running." Go with "Rode"? -->

Apple sailed across the shallow trench and his hooves tore chalk from the earth, and Thorne galloped toward the heights with his sword raised. The next shell only just missed him, skipping off the earth a few feet to the right of him. It detonated just behind him, deafening him as it showered the regiment with more shrapnel. Blinded by the spray of chalk from the glancing shell, he rode on, trusting his mount to run toward battle and the thunder of guns. He and his red horse were alike in their breeding.

Not until tears had bled the chalk from his eyes did Thorne realize that he was not alone. The regiment rode with him. Perhaps they thought an order had been given, or perhaps all control had been lost. Noble sons, like their horses, are spirited beasts, and given to eagerness. The thunder of guns and hooves filled the valley below the heights, and the Hussars rode into the mouth of Hell.

~

That night, the private soldiers of the 51st Rifles would see no Hussar's cup empty, though their own liquor was in short supply. They sang and drank, and they drank and sang, and they danced and embraced like brothers. To see the way they cheered the noble sons of the 17th, one would never know there had been enmity between the Rifles and the Hussars. Thorne's body ached, not from the battle, but from being crushed in the embrace of those veteran soldiers, and from being clapped on the back time and again.

Not because he had begun the charge. No one knew he had begun the charge. There were whispers of a young trooper who had been blown to pink shreds almost before he had passed the trench, but no one knew his name. No; the infantrymen embraced him and clapped his shoulders because he wore the cap of an hussar and a saber swung at his side, and on this one night that was enough.

He had not come through unscathed. Powder had seared him as he charged one of the guns, and he hadn't known it until the battle was done. Someone pointed out the blood dripping from his cuff, and a corporal-of-horse had torn open his jacket, but none of his wounds were larger than a pin-prick; he had been stabbed through in a hundred places, or a thousand, by the powder that burst from the mouth of the cannon. No more.

He felt none of it. He felt only the sweet embrace of life and the heady fog of liquor, not to mention its wondrous burn in his throat, and he wanted never to feel anything else again. He still envied the dead, of which the regiment had nearly three hundred, but now he felt he could wait another day to join them. Or at least one more night.

"That's enough," said a firm voice, well-accustomed to being obeyed, and a gloved hand pulled the bottle from his mouth. Captain Peters, his commanding officer, took the bottle and sat beside him. "Whiskey doesn't wash away pain, but only delays it. It is a coward's unguent."

Thorne's face burned red at those words, and he half rose, reaching for his sword hilt on the blanket beside him. It wasn't there. His protest died on his tongue, robbed of its meaning just as he had been robbed of his blade.

Peters held Thorne's sword in his hand. He drew it from the scabbard, and his lips pursed as he scanned the length of the blade. "Clean," he said. "Well cared for."

"It is my only precious thing," said Thorne, his words slurred by drink.

"Life is the only precious thing."

"I despise life!"

"Perhaps you do," said Peters. He turned the blade, and in the firelight he seemed to be examining the motto etched into the steel. He removed his glove and scraped at the letters with a fingernail, then drew his finger away to examine it. "Whose blood is this, Mr. Thorne?"

"How should I know?"

"Is it yours?"

Thorne laughed---a sound like a puppy being stabbed. He fell onto his side and lay there, laughing, never knowing the joke. "There was a gun captain," he said. "And his loaders. And the man at the trigger. There were men hauling shells. There was one pointing a rifle at me. It's their blood. It's all of their blood. The stains on the grip are mine."

<!-- Clarify that Thorne killed these people. -->

The captain nodded. Then he said, "It's good you weren't too thorough in your cleaning, Mr. Thorne. I might have mistaken you for a coward."

Fear raced through him again. The greater of two fears: fear of being un-manned rather than merely un-made. Even the whiskey could not silence that fear. "I'm not," he whispered. "I would sooner die."

"Be that as it may," said Captain Peters, "there is a rumor that the man who broke and started that... That strangely fortunate stroke of misfortune... That he was an ordinary trooper, much like yourself. Young, slight of build, and impetuous. As they say, a pretty boy on a pretty horse."

Thorne swallowed, or would have. His mouth had become too dry.

"It would be unfortunate," said Peters, "if anyone were to mistake you for him. If he is ever found out, you see, he will be hanged by the neck until dead."

The boy said nothing. The pretty boy with the pretty horse surprised himself by feeling nothing at this pronouncement. To be dead was to be dead, and to have known the end of fear. A strange sense of peace came over him at the thought, and he was silent.

Captain Peters threw something at him in the half-dark of the firelight, and Thorne saw that it was a uniform jacket, bloodied and torn. It had belonged to a lieutenant, for it carried a lieutenant's markings.

"You, hereby, are my lieutenant by brevet," said Peters. "Lose your old jacket. And, if anyone asks, you've a lieutenant's pay to go with your lieutenant's bars. To ensure that no mistakes are made."

"Yes, sir." Thorne pushed his arm into the blood-stiff sleeve, and he fumbled drunkenly at the buttons. "Sir?"

"War is an uglier thing now," said the captain, "than it was in the days of my youth. For that, I would give you another chance. Never speak of it."

"Yes, sir."

The captain returned his sword and arose. That night, Thorne slept until the whiskey left him, and he awoke trembling before morning.

~

The fall of the heights over Haolien was the beginning of the end. The campaign drew to a close, not with thunder, but with the scratch of pens, and a colony at the edge of civilization changed hands. The crown on the seal on the letters from the governor changed. The destination of the taxes collected and the goods produced changed. For the native peoples of that place, of the Valley of Hell, and of the province of Ul-shann, it meant only that the laws were now written in another language they didn't know.

The boy's brevet appointment was made permanent even before the regiment had withdrawn from the field, but the letter took a month to find him. His father called it a gift for his seventeenth birthday; he had purchased an commission for his son, which was only delayed by confusion at the regimental headquarters. A trooper by that name had already been promoted in the field.

A note from his father accompanied that letter:

> C,

> I trust that you will uphold the best traditions of my house.

> Signed, S

A letter from his mother arrived the week after that, longer, more beautifully written, and impossible to read for the pangs he felt with every word. She spoke of his sisters and their small travails and how he was missed and loved and how she longed for him to be home and safe again and how father wasn't so bad as all that, and she reminded him of his promise to write, letter for letter, just as he had been taught. And so he wrote.

> I am well, Mother. The food is not good, and there is trouble whenever the Foot and Horse meet one another, but it is no great hardship here. I miss our home, and I miss hunting, and I miss the forest behind the house. And I miss Bellesa, and little Jan, too, of course.

> Would you please write to Messrs. Colton and Hobbe for a new uniform jacket? Two would be better. My size has not changed; if anything, I am a little smaller now than I was. My rank, though, has changed. Not through Father's meddling, if you can believe it! Though I know he won't. I am now a lieutenant, though I feel I hardly know how to pack my own meal kit.

> The captain has requested that I be sent to Danes upon our return. He says that a mouth filled with sharp fangs is of no use to an empty head. I believe that amounts to an insult, but I am mindful of my promise to you about dueling. I don't think I will like college. I suppose it can't be worse than war, except in that it will be boring all the time rather than most of the time.

> Love, your Caspian.

To his father, he wrote a more honest letter:

> Father,

> It is my heart's desire never to return to your house, let alone to reflect poorly upon its traditions.

> C

But he did return. With a new uniform jacket, with his new rank, and with his family sword worn at his side, he rode with the 17th Hussars into the capital some four months after the Battle of Haolien. Girls blew kisses and boys saluted in the street, and older gentlemen gave nods of quiet respect to these newly-blooded veterans, and the pretty boy on the pretty horse reflected that his courage had grown in four months: he did not run this time.

Then again, perhaps that was only because, now, there was nowhere to run to.

~ 2602

The girls saw him first. They spotted him coming up the pike, between the silver-barked trees of the estate, and they ran down the road until the gateman stopped them, and there they waited, red-cheeked and panting. Thorne dismounted, throwing his leg over Apple's neck and dropping to catch little Jan in his arms. She squealed as he pulled her away from the horse, erupting with a combination of fury and giggling.

"You brought him home safe?" she asked, wriggling in his arms as she reached for Apple's tack.

"Yes, he's safe," said Thorne, and he deposited her carefully on the saddle; it seemed the best way to prevent disaster. Apple was a calm enough beast when there were no cannon involved, but it didn't do to train the more aggressive instincts out of a warhorse. "Now, be still, or I'll take you down."

The tiny, white-blonde girl bounced in the saddle as though riding at a canter, although Apple ignored her but for a grouchy grunt. "Hey! What happened to his ear?"

The notch at the tip of Apple's right ear was new, but it wasn't a battle wound. The triangular cutting---literally an *earmark*---designated Apple as the private property of his rider, which released the regimental farriers from certain responsibilities regarding the animal should it be killed in combat. For example, when an animal owned by the regiment fell in battle, it fell to the farrier to lop off the beast's hoof in order to prove it had been killed.

"Just a bit of shrapnel," said Thorne. "Nothing we couldn't handle!" Quite frankly, it seemed wiser to let Jan believe that the enemy had done that to her brother's tall, red horse, as opposed to trying to explain why he'd been forced to do it himself.

"Apple is quite a brave horse, isn't he!"

"The very bravest."

Bellesa kept silent. Her mouth twitched when Thorne blamed the enemy for the earmark, but she said nothing. She was much older than their little sister---nearly as old as Thorne himself, though not quite old enough to have been married off yet---and she would understand the reason he had lied.

"The newspapers," said Bellesa as Thorne, Apple, and Jan made their way up the path toward her, "claim that a young trooper distinguished himself quite thoroughly. Didn't our mother make herself clear? She said that you were to do nothing of any particular merit. Nothing whatsoever! Isn't that right, Jan?"

Jan knew enough to agree with her older sister, whatever she said. "Nothing!" she said with a nod.

Thorne's cheeks flared red. "Whatever the papers said, I can assure you that I achieved nothing of note."

Bellesa mistook Thorne's shame for bashful humility, and she hugged him tight. "We're all glad you're home and safe again. I only hope you don't need to leave again too soon."

"The war is over. I should have a little while."

"The war is over, and another is beginning. That is the way of things, after all."

"Another? I hadn't heard."

"Not that kind of war, silly."

"What, then?"

"You'll see."

The head groom met them at the inner gate and took both Apple and Jan to the stables. Bellesa led her brother to where their mother had been painting, on the verandah overlooking the east garden. She smiled at him but did not set aside her brushes; when the muse was upon her, she didn't like to stop.

"It's good you're here," said his mother. "I've been meaning to do your portrait. Can you stand for me?"

"Stand where, Mother?"

"Not now," she said, laughing. "Next week, perhaps. I've been asked to do the princess---the young Countess of Troy?---so it would be nice to have some practice. I've done only landscapes of late."

"Father prefers that, doesn't he?"

Both Bellesa and his mother scowled at his comment. His mother had nurtured a renowned talent over the past nine decades, having picked up painting when she was but a girl. Now she was one of the most sought-after painters in the Empire, but his father, the Lord Thorne, rankled to see her paid for her work. The wife of a Ritter was not meant to work, but to indulge in whatever passions inflamed her.

"You, of all people," said his mother, and she hid her smile, "ought not to concern yourself with what your father prefers."

At last, his mother set aside her brush, and she rose from the saddle, lifting her arms as if to embrace him. Thorne stood forward, ready to be embraced, but he was rebuffed and held at arm's length as she examined him. He dropped his arms to his side and pretended not to be surprised.

"Still no spurt, hm?" she said, her face severe. It was a strange look on one who normally seemed so young and so carefree. "It will come. Soon, I think."

It was strange to hear her talk of his coming growth spurt. He already stood nine leaves in height, which was a goodly height even among the nobility; it was stones he was wanting.

"That is the magic of a portrait," she said, and her mouth took on that same twitch of mischief he'd seen in Bellesa's earlier at the gate before she wrapped him up in a welcoming hug at last. "The painter may paint what she knows rather than what she sees. Now, you've wasted enough time with your mum. The prelate is here, all the way from Wick. He's been waiting all week to see you."

"But, Mother," he began, and he realized with some embarrassment that he did not want to be parted from her again so soon---from her familiar face, her golden curls, and her soft voice. "If he's waited so long, can he not wait another few minutes?"

"Enough of such talk," she scoffed. "And don't let me hear about you questioning his choice, either. The Church's word is law in this house. It always has been."

Thorne's cheeks once more burned as he retreated from the verandah. He always felt embarrassment when he thought of the Church, or of the role it would play in his life. His embarrassment had only been stronger since the winter before, when his father had caught him by the hearth, under a sprig of mistletoe, with the daughter of a prominent merchant.

~ 3676

Lord Thorne had been furious. After the fashion of the upper classes, he had said nothing at all; he went to the butler, whispered a few words, and left the hall. The butler, in the politest possible terms, invited the young lady to leave, and she broke into tears as she ran from the room. The butler shrugged at Thorne, saying, "Ah, the sweet folly of youth."

That night, Thorne and his father shouted at one another for an hour. The next morning, Thorne took Apple and the family sword and rode to muster to join the now-famous Bloody 17th.

The House of Thorne had long held a reputation as one of the most pious families in the Empire. At times, it seemed that piety did them profit; at others, it seemed likely to bring about their ruin instead. Even so, his father's faith in the Church was unshakeable---though, perhaps, that had less to do with faith and more to do with the debts he supposedly owed to the Church.

Thorne went to the chapel, which stood just outside the hedge maze in the east garden. There, at a table in the shade of a grand old tree, the prelate partook of an early lunch of bread, wine, cheeses, what Thorne took to be venison. The prelate was a man with gray hair, a youthful countenance, and an easy sense of authority about him; this authority was buttressed by the presence of a trio of ecclesial wardens who accompanied him.

Each of the wardens wore the brigandine armor of his office, with golden rivets set in rich, crimson leather, and each bore a magnificent longsword, the blade of which was never to be sheathed. Even now, three beautifully etched blades with lustrous gold damask, shone in the sunlight. Both the armor and the weapon of an ecclesial warden were ceremonial, in some sense. Just not in the sense that they weren't also entirely functional.

Ecclesial steel was famous for its keen edge and wondrous toughness. Thorne had been permitted to hold a warden's sword once, in secret. In the sepulcher, in Wick, he held his breath and plucked at the edge of the blade with the pad of his thumb. The sword sang in his hand, vibrating with thirst and with the life hammered into the steel by the smith's craft. To his amazement, red blood welled up from his thumb. Even after all his lessons with the fencing master, he had been entirely unprepared to handle such a sword. Since that day, he had regarded the wardens with awe, and not a little fear.

"Here he is at last!" said the prelate, smiling and rising from his place at the board. "Bishop Driscoll, at your service my young lord. May I say that I have been eagerly awaiting this meeting for some time? And I don't mean simply these past five days."

One of the wardens rose with him, cradling the length of his longsword across his folded arms. The others remained seated, drinking and eating and seemingly amused by their master's formality. That formality, however, was essential for Thorne.

Something in the bishop's voice, or in his smile, made Thorne certain that his pride was being pricked. Of course, to challenge a bishop to a duel was unthinkable, especially in the presence of his wardens; all Thorne could do was to bow low, introduce himself, and smile back. "You have been waiting for this?" he added, genuine curiosity in his voice. "Why?"

"Because now is your lighting day," said the bishop. "Now, we will see what course is set out for the rest of your life."

"Now?"

"Yes, now," said Driscoll, and already he was heading for the chapel. "What better time? You could have been killed off in Untu Buntu; may as well strike while the iron is hot. Or at least before the iron gets deployed once more and is blown to bits, right?"

Church law, as dense and inscrutable as the fog on the Darby, set out the rules by which a man's lighting day was chosen. While a woman's lighting day was usually on or about her sixteenth birthday, a man was not lighted until he was considered, well and truly, a man---usually not before twenty-five, and often much later. Thorne had been dimly aware that war veterans were treated differently to a degree. Until that moment, he had not thought of himself as a veteran at all.

The familiar interior of the chapel was unexpectedly reassuring. Thorne was entering new and undiscovered territory, at once exciting and frightening. He spent some time examining those feelings while pretending to examine the stained glass above the altar: examining a feeling in detail made it easier to pretend that the feeling belonged to someone else, and therefore not to feel it at all.

"Hard to believe your house has survived more than seven hundred years," said Driscoll. He, too, was examining the stained glass.

Thorne wondered if the bishop was able to read the stars in the glass---to calculate, by their positions, the age of the House of Thorne and of the titles held by the Ritter of Dunmar---of if he had simply read that in some book on the peerage. He also wondered if the bishop were deliberately trying to make him angry, but the warden and his golden sword had followed them into the chapel. Thorne chose his words with care.

"We serve at the pleasure of the Imperial household," he said. "We will serve for as long as may be required."

"In point of fact," said Driscoll, "you have served *three* Imperial households. You've held these lands longer than any king, queen, or emperor in living memory. Do you know why that is?"

"Because---"

"Stop," said Driscoll, putting up his hand and wearing a look of disgust. "No answer given that quickly could possibly be well-considered."

"Then why?"

"Never mind." Driscoll approached the altar, along with the white candle waiting there, and the warden took up his post at the entrance. And the exit. "Perhaps, when you are older, you will understand. For now, just know that your house occupies a certain place in the plans of the Church. Are you prepared to do your part?"

Thorne set his jaw and gave a nod. "I am."

The bishop offered him a knife. Thin, sharp as a razor, and damasked with patterns and inscriptions in gold much like the warden's sword, the blade felt heavy in Thorne's hand. Thorne lifted his eyes toward the bishop, weighted down with an unspoken question.

"The palm is traditional," said Driscoll. "Here. Along the life line."

He nodded. He pressed the edge against his palm, and at first he thought it didn't cut. All at once, the blood began to flow, and pain seared him, and he had to remind himself it was only a little cut. That he was a Hussar of the Bloody 17th. That he was a man, and this was his lighting day, and he must not show pain.

Driscoll took him by the wrist and held his dripping hand over the white candle. Red blood ran down its pale flanks, staining the wax and the wick, and Thorne swayed on his feet. The task done, Driscoll pressed a long strip of heavy linen into his hand.

"Wrap it," said Driscoll.

Thorne pulled the linen tight, binding his bleeding palm, and he swallowed. Incense filled his next breath as Driscoll struck a match anointed with sacred oil, and the prelate touched the glowing flame to the blood-bathed wick. The words of a nursery rhyme fluttered through Thorne's head as the chapel spun around him.

<!-- The candle flame burns a different color to represent each caste. White is an ordinary peasant. Gold is a peer. Black is corrupt, meaning that the bloodline must be ended. Red is for the royal bloodlines. -->

> See the taper burning bright
> See the candle set alight
> See the churchman standing near
> See the white flame, have no fear

> Golden, golden, brave and bold
> Golden flames for men of old
> When the wick burns like the sun
> Joyful, joyful, every one

> Gutter gutter, weak and cold
> Dark'ning flames the wicked hold
> Sickness lives within his heart
> Warden, warden, do your part

> Rarest flame, above them all
> Crimson flame to greatness calls
> Snuff the candle, courage take
> Blood of sovereigns must awake

<!-- I'm not married to it. Maybe someone else can come up with something better. -->

Not black. Anything but black. It wouldn't turn black; his family was seven centuries old. Every Thorne had been lighted golden, going all the way back to... He couldn't remember his great, great, great, great grandfather's name. It was something easy to remember. How silly of him. But it couldn't turn black.

White was for peasants. Gold for the peerage. Black for the outcast. Perhaps the flame would turn white; he'd be as good as an outcast then, but he didn't think he'd mind. He could become a fencing master, like old Porinco, with his wide moustache and his bushy brows. He would travel the world, from city to city, teaching noble sons the art of the sword, and they would love and hate him in equal measure, just like old Porinco.

Bishop Driscoll drew in a sharp breath, and Thorne's eyes opened. Their eyes met for an instant---and only for an instant---before Driscoll pinched the wick with the fingers of a gloved hand, snuffing out the candle flame.

Red. The candle had burned blood red.

Still dizzy from the cut on his hand, or perhaps from the sacred incense, Thorne was slow to understand. He raised his hand and the knife, thinking to offer to try again. Red was the wrong color. He didn't notice the quick footsteps behind him, or else he failed to realize their meaning.

Driscoll shouted a warning, but Thorne didn't move. The bishop took him by the collar and slung him across the room, pushing the altar over onto the floor and into the path of the oncoming warden.

Thorne lay sprawled across the stone as the warden sliced the air where Driscoll's head had been only an instant earlier. "It was red," he said. "Not black. It was red."

"He knows that!" said Driscoll, who tried to defend himself with a communion cup. "Why do you think the song said to snuff it out? What are you doing down there? Run!"

The command to run seemed to strike both Thorne and the warden at the same time. Thorne scrambled to his feet as the warden left the bishop and came for him. He slipped, his hobnailed boots gaining no purchase on the polished stone, and he realized that the ecclesial sword would split him like firewood. It would be the cleanest cut he'd ever seen. He cowered, throwing his hands over his head.

No. A gentleman should face death with open eyes.

Thorne had only just decided to lower his hands when a shot rang out and the air filled with the stench of gunpowder. He looked up to see the warden stagger, the magnificent sword slipping from his grasp. The man turned toward the bishop and another deafening blast filled the air with blue smoke, and the sword sang as it fell to the ground.

The other two wardens entered, and Thorne knew what he had to do. He took up the warden's longsword, and he braced himself to face them---and then the prelate shoved him, whacked him with the communion cup.

"Young fool, run!"

Thorne could hardly hear him over the ringing in his ears, but then two more pistol shots echoed thunderously through the chapel. For a moment, Thorne thought it strange that he hadn't seen Driscoll fire, and then he saw the spreading stain on the prelate's jacket, and he looked back to the wardens to see the not-at-all ceremonial revolvers in their hands.

He ran. He threw the sword on the ground and ran. He went out the door behind the altar and, sprinting pell mell, ducked into the hedge maze in the east garden. Another shot burst behind him, muffled by the branches, and the ball tore through the leaves beside him. He looked back just long enough to see the two wardens close behind him, and he ran.

<!-- If I had to guess what's going to happen, it's this: Driscoll will lie and say that the flame was black *to save Thorne's life.* He will then claim that the shootout was a misunderstanding. Thorne will be saved only by his "heroic" acts at Haolien: he has won the Blue and Black, and no man who has been awarded such an honor can be entirely discarded. -->

Some changes to make to the above:

1. Rearrange the scene breaks so that the last scene ends with Thorne running away on his horse and falling off before he can clear the fence on his way out.
2. Maybe go ahead and put the other stuff back in. (parade, drinking, fight, winning the medal...) This scene should basically end act 1/move us into the "magical" world.
3. Thorne is rescued from being put to death by the Grand Duke, who points out that, as a winner of the Blue and Black, he cannot be considered dishonorable. Instead, he is outcast, leaving him outside the protection of the law.
4. The church believes him to be a black flame, meaning they wish to put him to death. The ruling dynasty doesn't necessarily hold the same opinion; they're suspicious, but they dare not go against the Grand Duke, who is the most powerful man in the Empire other than the Emperor himself.
5. The duke is the "pirate" who offered to buy all of Salter's debt, and it is Salter's boat that will carry Thorne and Sergeant Major Patterson to a far-off colony, where the Duke is digging for something very secret.
6. The reason Thorne fell off his horse is that the knife they use for these tests is coated in a kind of narcotic.
