# Chapter 1

Thunder echoed from the far ridge: the report of cannon, and the burst of shellfire. Smoke, drifting from the gun pits cut in the sticky chalk of the Haolien Valley, stung the eyes and caught in the throat. A faint flash and a glut of gray smoke was the only sign as the guns on the heights made reply, sending their metal rain back into the valley to tear new craters in the chalk, and to tear men asunder.

Cries rang out, sharp and rending, and clods of earth fell across the shallow trenches of Her Majesty's Own 51st Rifles. This Hell was theirs, and had been theirs alone for three days. Now, without water, short on ammunition, and shelled to ribbons, they were ready to break. Now the hammer would fall. Now, into this Hell, rode the 17th Hussars.

Pretty boys on pretty horses. Oh, how they shine!

Do they know which end of a shovel goes into the earth?

Don't be cross, lads. The battle is over. Don't you see? The Gray Goats would never risk so many noble sons.

Oh, but they would. Easier to risk noble sons, because noble sons lacked the courage to flee in the face of the enemy. A private soldier might turn and run, break and save himself, but a baron's boy? It would be suicide. Better to die than to face that shame: better to be un-made than un-manned, and to be cast out from all he had known. So it was that the pretty boy on the pretty horse was caught between two fears, and those fears warred to see which was the greater.

His name was Thorne. His sword, etched with the family's most ancient motto, declared *Vincere Vel Mori*---Conquer or Die---and his hand clenched at its hilt so that none could see he was shaking. Yesterday, he had been without fear. Yesterday, the 17th had marched past an abandoned trench.

The boy, only sixteen, could not forget the stench of death. It stuck in his nostrils and clawed at his mind. He could not forget the sight of bloated, sun-baked corpses, or of the flies and their maggots crawling on sightless, yellowed eyes. He could not forget the plaintive cry of a mangled man pleading for water.

Water or death.

Victory or death.

The boy could accept victory or death. He could embrace either, openly, gladly, with joy in his heart, but to spend days in a trench waiting and praying for death to come... Captain Peters had shot the man through the head with a pistol, at last granting him relief, but that same relief had not been granted to the boy named Thorne.

Yesterday, the 17th had been issued breach-loading rifles and cartridge belts. Even now, a heavy, brown box pressed painfully into the boy's side, laden with .464 caliber rounds, and the weight of a rifle sling bore down on his narrow shoulder. He could shoot. He had learned to hunt as soon as he had learned to ride, and he had learned to ride almost before he could walk, but the rifle was not a gentleman's weapon. It was crude, and heavy, and stank of tar and rotted eggs, and it represented a coward's way of war. Could they not meet the enemy face to face?

Oh, how glad he would be to meet the enemy! Let him stand nose to nose, blade to blade, and be tested. Let him go out and bleed and die, or kill and conquer, whatever the result, but do not ask him to dig his own grave and lie in it and wait for the end.

For a merciful bullet through the head.

For the sun to bleach and bloat his corpse.

For the sappers to cover him over.

"Hussars, prepare to dismount!"

Apple, the boy's pretty horse, quivered beneath him. The beast felt the thunderous voice of the cannon on the heights through its very hooves, even before the shell had come. An instant later, fragments of scorched and twisted metal pierced the very air, singeing clothing and shredding flesh: the shell had fallen short, activating its fuse as it glanced off the earth, and it burst in the air as it passed by the Hussars. A perfect shot.

Blood gushed, shooting across the white chalk from the throat of the man before him. How lucky that man was, to receive a certain death, quick and painless! Thorne would have cried out but for the heart that pounded in his own throat, and Apple shifted uneasily beneath him, responding to his fear.

And then there was a cry: a wordless, primal scream of impotent rage and fear. There was a cry, accompanied by the silent whisper of steel as his family sword sprang from the scabbard, and only as the blade rose up, blazing under the harsh blue sky, did Thorne realize that cry was his. He shrugged off the weight of the rifle on his shoulder, threw down his cartridge box, and he broke from the regiment.

He ran. He was running. Without orders. Against orders. But he was not a coward. Never let it be said that he ran from the enemy, or that he feared death. Let them say that he sought death with greater sincerity, with more eagerness, than others.

<!-- Change "He ran. He was running." Go with "Rode"? -->

Apple sailed across the shallow trench and his hooves tore chalk from the earth, and Thorne galloped toward the heights with his sword raised. The next shell only just missed him, skipping off the earth a few feet to the right of him. It detonated just behind him, deafening him as it showered the regiment with more shrapnel. Blinded by the spray of chalk from the glancing shell, he rode on, trusting his mount to run toward battle and the thunder of guns. He and his red horse were alike in their breeding.

Not until tears had bled the chalk from his eyes did Thorne realize that he was not alone. The regiment rode with him. Perhaps they thought an order had been given, or perhaps all control had been lost. Noble sons, like their horses, are spirited beasts, and given to eagerness. The thunder of guns and hooves filled the valley below the heights, and the Hussars rode into the mouth of Hell.

~

That night, the private soldiers of the 51st Rifles would see no Hussar's cup empty, though their own liquor was in short supply. They sang and drank, and they drank and sang, and they danced and embraced like brothers. To see the way they cheered the noble sons of the 17th, one would never know there had been enmity between the Rifles and the Hussars. Thorne's body ached, not from the battle, but from being crushed in the embrace of those veteran soldiers, and from being clapped on the back time and again.

Not because he had begun the charge. No one knew he had begun the charge. There were whispers of a young trooper who had been blown to pink shreds almost before he had passed the trench, but no one knew his name. No; the infantrymen embraced him and clapped his shoulders because he wore the cap of an hussar and a saber swung at his side, and on this one night that was enough.

He had not come through unscathed. Powder had seared him as he charged one of the guns, and he hadn't known it until the battle was done. Someone pointed out the blood dripping from his cuff, and a corporal-of-horse had torn open his jacket, but none of his wounds were larger than a pin-prick; he had been stabbed through in a hundred places, or a thousand, by the powder that burst from the mouth of the cannon. No more.

He felt none of it. He felt only the sweet embrace of life and the heady fog of liquor, not to mention its wondrous burn in his throat, and he wanted never to feel anything else again. He still envied the dead, of which the regiment had nearly three hundred, but now he felt he could wait another day to join them. Or at least one more night.

"That's enough," said a firm voice, well-accustomed to being obeyed, and a gloved hand pulled the bottle from his mouth. Captain Peters, his commanding officer, took the bottle and sat beside him. "Whiskey doesn't wash away pain, but only delays it. It is a coward's unguent."

Thorne's face burned red at those words, and he half rose, reaching for his sword hilt on the blanket beside him. It wasn't there. His protest died on his tongue, robbed of its meaning just as he had been robbed of his blade.

Peters held Thorne's sword in his hand. He drew it from the scabbard, and his lips pursed as he scanned the length of the blade. "Clean," he said. "Well cared for."

"It is my only precious thing," said Thorne, his words slurred by drink.

"Life is the only precious thing."

"I despise life!"

"Perhaps you do," said Peters. He turned the blade, and in the firelight he seemed to be examining the motto etched into the steel. He removed his glove and scraped at the letters with a fingernail, then drew his finger away to examine it. "Whose blood is this, Mr. Thorne?"

"How should I know?"

"Is it yours?"

Thorne laughed---a sound like a puppy being stabbed. He fell onto his side and lay there, laughing, never knowing the joke. "There was a gun captain," he said. "And his loaders. And the man at the trigger. There were men hauling shells. There was one pointing a rifle at me. It's their blood. It's all of their blood. The stains on the grip are mine."

<!-- Clarify that Thorne killed these people. -->

The captain nodded. Then he said, "It's good you weren't too thorough in your cleaning, Mr. Thorne. I might have mistaken you for a coward."

Fear raced through him again. The greater of two fears: fear of being un-manned rather than merely un-made. Even the whiskey could not silence that fear. "I'm not," he whispered. "I would sooner die."

"Be that as it may," said Captain Peters, "there is a rumor that the man who broke and started that... That strangely fortunate stroke of misfortune... That he was an ordinary trooper, much like yourself. Young, slight of build, and impetuous. As they say, a pretty boy on a pretty horse."

Thorne swallowed, or would have. His mouth had become too dry.

"It would be unfortunate," said Peters, "if anyone were to mistake you for him. If he is ever found out, you see, he will be hanged by the neck until dead."

The boy said nothing. The pretty boy with the pretty horse surprised himself by feeling nothing at this pronouncement. To be dead was to be dead, and to have known the end of fear. A strange sense of peace came over him at the thought, and he was silent.

Captain Peters threw something at him in the half-dark of the firelight, and Thorne saw that it was a uniform jacket, bloodied and torn. It had belonged to a lieutenant, for it carried a lieutenant's markings.

"You, hereby, are my lieutenant by brevet," said Peters. "Lose your old jacket. And, if anyone asks, you've a lieutenant's pay to go with your lieutenant's bars. To ensure that no mistakes are made."

"Yes, sir." Thorne pushed his arm into the blood-stiff sleeve, and he fumbled drunkenly at the buttons. "Sir?"

"War is an uglier thing now," said the captain, "than it was in the days of my youth. For that, I would give you another chance. Never speak of it."

"Yes, sir."

The captain returned his sword and arose. That night, Thorne slept until the whiskey left him, and he awoke trembling before morning.

~

The fall of the heights over Haolien was the beginning of the end. The campaign drew to a close, not with thunder, but with the scratch of pens, and a colony at the edge of civilization changed hands. The crown on the seal on the letters from the governor changed. The destination of the taxes collected and the goods produced changed. For the native peoples of that place, of the Valley of Hell, and of the province of Ul-shann, it meant only that the laws were now written in another language they didn't know.

The boy's brevet appointment was made permanent even before the regiment had withdrawn from the field, but the letter took a month to find him. His father called it a gift for his seventeenth birthday; he had purchased an commission for his son, which was only delayed by confusion at the regimental headquarters. A trooper by that name had already been promoted in the field.

A note from his father accompanied that letter:

> C,

> I trust that you will uphold the best traditions of my house.

> Signed, S

A letter from his mother arrived the week after that, longer, more beautifully written, and impossible to read for the pangs he felt with every word. She spoke of his sisters and their small travails and how he was missed and loved and how she longed for him to be home and safe again and how father wasn't so bad as all that, and she reminded him of his promise to write, letter for letter, just as he had been taught. And so he wrote.

> I am well, Mother. The food is not good, and there is trouble whenever the Foot and Horse meet one another, but it is no great hardship here. I miss our home, and I miss hunting, and I miss the forest behind the house. And I miss Bellesa, and little Jan, too, of course.

> Would you please write to Messrs. Colton and Hobbe for a new uniform jacket? Two would be better. My size has not changed; if anything, I am a little smaller now than I was. My rank, though, has changed. Not through Father's meddling, if you can believe it! Though I know he won't. I am now a lieutenant, though I feel I hardly know how to pack my own meal kit.

> The captain has requested that I be sent to Danes upon our return. He says that a mouth filled with sharp fangs is of no use to an empty head. I believe that amounts to an insult, but I am mindful of my promise to you about dueling. I don't think I will like college. I suppose it can't be worse than war, except in that it will be boring all the time rather than most of the time.

> Love, your Caspian.

To his father, he wrote a more honest letter:

> Father,

> It is my heart's desire never to return to your house, let alone to reflect poorly upon its traditions.

> C

But he did return. With a new uniform jacket, with his new rank, and with his family sword worn at his side, he rode with the 17th Hussars into the capital some four months after the Battle of Haolien. Girls blew kisses and boys saluted in the street, and older gentlemen gave nods of quiet respect to these newly-blooded veterans, and the pretty boy on the pretty horse reflected that his courage had grown in four months: he did not run this time.

Then again, perhaps that was only because, now, there was nowhere to run to.

~

Horses and horse's asses and horse shit clogged the high street for the better part of an hour, right at the middle of midday, when common folk had things to do and places to be. Oh, it was a pretty enough parade, to be sure, with bands playing and banners dancing in the breeze, but couldn't they have picked tomorrow? Why today, of all days? Why today, when Salter had just put into port?

"Relax," muttered Gramble, his ship's master. "Wouldn't kill you to cheer. Say God save the Queen, just once? If the almighty won't save her, he's not looking out for you, I can tell you."

"No, I won't," said Salter. "These poffs think we've nothing better to do than wait hand and foot on them. It's preposterous!"

Gramble heaved a longsuffering sigh, but Salter noticed the way he rolled his eyes: to Gramble, Salter was probably just one short step removed from those poffs he railed against. Salter pursed his lips and looked away. It was true that the merchant class could hardly be compared to common laborers, but his family had come by its fortune by good, honest trading, if not by a good, honest trade.

<!-- "Salter" is an occupational name for one who sells salt. -->

"It'll be over soon," said Gramble, nodding toward the parade. "See there? The 17th Hussars. They'll have the honor of riding last today. Covered them-damn-selves in glory at Holler Valley, or some such."

"A likely story," sniffed Salter. "They probably arrived just in time to take credit after the infantry bore the brunt of the fighting."

"Begging your pardon, sir," said Gramble, "but you'll be wanting to belay that kind of talk. I know you fancy yourself one of the lads, but here...." Gramble left the sentence unfinished, perhaps afraid of giving offense.

"Here what, Mr. Gramble?"

"Well, you're not so different from them, are you?"

"Mr. Gramble, I'm surprised at you. You know me to be a fair man, and sincere, and that I believe firmly in the equality of all."

"Of course you do, sir," said Gramble, "but there's the rub. If you and them are equal, you're subject to their code of honor. A wharf rat like me can speak as he likes, but a gentlemanly fellow like yourself should watch his tongue."

"Ah. I see."

The 17th Hussars passed by: handsome, young men, all members of the nobility, of one stripe or another, and all mounted on tall, beautiful horses. He had seen such regiments on parade a dozen times or more, but not quite like this. The 17th Hussars were bloodied by a recent fight; their wounds had healed, but scars remained. The signs were visible for one who cared to look: in the livid weal on one man's face, or in another's missing arm. And yet that wasn't the worst of it.

Salter, throughout his life, was accustomed to seeing the Queen's cavalry regiments on parade at their full, authorized strength of four squadrons, or more than seven hundred men. Somehow, the 17th had been reduced from four squadrons to only two. The regiment had lost nearly fifty percent of its strength in one battle.

"Paper said these lads gave the Carolingians hell," said Grambler, and the barrel-chested seaman pressed his fist to his heart in salute as they went by. "God save the Queen," he called, his voice roaring out with the rest of the crowd, "and God have mercy on him who stands before the Hussars!"

At Grambler's cry, the Hussars drew their swords and cheered in reply, spirited young men on hot-blooded horses. One great, smoke gray gelding reared up as though on command, and its rider shouted, "May God have mercy, for we have none!"

The sound of drums and and bugles began to swell until their fury caused Salter's ribs to clatter against one another, and even the cheering roar of the crowd was drowned out as the 17th Hussars began their regimental song. They began with the third verse---being the *return,* while each regiment's song began with first a *levy,* then a *parting*---and repeated only that verse as they marched, their horses stamping proudly as they went. It was as if they did not know fully half their brothers in arms lay cold in the earth of some foreign land.

Salter shivered when they had gone.

Grambler gave him a curious look.

"Well?" said Salter. "Come on, then!"

First the stock exchange, where he would secure the sale of his goods. His good which, as a matter of course, included several tons of salt, which meant that the very next thing he would do would be to bear with good grace the ribbing that would naturally follow. It wasn't *his* salt; his surname hadn't been literally true in three generations. After that, he would purchase bulk goods for the next leg of the trip, down to southern colonies, and he would lay in a good stock of supply for the journey in case he and his crew needed to winter there.

Grambler pressed a newspaper into his hand, interrupting his thoughts.

"What is this? I don't want this."

"Read."

"Heroic 17th returns home," he said, frowning at the headline.

"Not that."

"Lieutenant mentioned in dispatches?"

"No."

"Second naval law passed?"

"Damn it, here!" Gramble planted a thick, calloused finger on the page, all the way at the bottom.

"Ul-shann opened to trade," said Salter. "Well, I don't see how that matters. Perhaps next year we can make a trip there for... For...."

For salt. For countless tons of precious, perfect, pure salt. For salt that would normally take months to dry and grade, to clean and collect, and to ship from the horse latitudes back to civilization. For more salt than any man in the empire knew what to do with. The first shipments from Ul-shann would be arriving in days, if they hadn't already.

Salter broke into a run, hurtling breakneck through the streets, bouncing from shop to corner and from corner to shop, overturning carts and old women and apologizing only in breathless passing. He ran, clutching his manifest to his chest, and he prayed.

He was too late.

The price of salt, the bulk of his cargo, had already fallen from six crowns and twelve to just twelve---hardly any more than he had paid to begin with. The air felt close. His collar was too tight. His stomach roiled and he panted, sweating.

"Salt, right?" asked a man with a cocked hat and a twinkling smile.

Salter nodded. For a moment, he wondered how the man knew. Only for a moment.

"Let's just have a look," said the man, who took Salter's manifest and whistled at what he saw on the page. "Oh, my. My, my, my... Tsk. You have made a poor wager, haven't you."

"I---I have."

Soon, he would have no worries of being mistaken for a gentleman. He would be able to speak his mind as freely as Grambler, and no one would take offense, because no one would care what he said. He wouldn't even have the old family business to fall back on. Not unless something happened to close the mines again. Perhaps he could blow them up. He laughed as the man with the twinkling smile tut-tutted at him.

"And yet you are in luck," said the man. "I represent Mayben, Jennings, and Roth, and I am prepared to offer you three crowns and six for the balance of your stores."

"What? Three... Three *crowns?"*

Half price. Certainly, it was only half price, but it was more than ten times what he might have gotten in an honest sale---and yet that very thought troubled him. An *honest* sale: which made this *dishonest,* didn't it?

"Why three crowns?"

"Three crowns and six, my good man," said the man with the twinkling, well-practiced smile, "because it is the opinion of Messrs Mayben, Jennings, and Roth that the empire cannot do without adventuresome businessmen like yourself. Consider the price as a small investment in the future of the realm."

The man smiled and put out his hand, but Salter didn't take it.

"Join me for a drink," said the man. "We'll discuss the particulars over an ale. That, at least, must be amenable?"

Just then, Grambler caught up in time to see Salter headed for the nearest pub in the company of the unnamed man with the twinkling, lying smile. Grambler shot him a dour look, and Salter shrugged. He shrugged, and he went for drinks with the pirate.

~

A regiment's song had three verses: the levy, the parting, and the return. There was no verse for battle, for that part was sung by hard, ringing steel, the booming voice of guns, and the rattle of rifle fire; by the scream of horses and the dying and the damned; by the silence that ruled when the armies had gone. The silence of the grave, broken only by the cries of carrion birds wheeling in the blue sky.

There was, however, a fourth verse.

Each regiment's fourth verse, the Long Verse, was known only to the members of the regiment. When it was sung---if ever it was sung---it was only on the way to battle. That verse consisted of the names of the regiment's fallen. For the 17th Hussars, the Long Verse began with the Battle of Hoarfront, with the names of Andrew Marlbrew, William Easton, Samuel Atick, and Earnest Pettigrew. Four Hussars had fallen on the Hoarfront, in the first combat listed among the regiment's battle honors, and their sacrifice had begun the Long Verse.

In nearly one hundred years of service to the Atlantean Empire, that verse had grown to only two hundred and fourteen names. In a single day---one, black day in Haolien---that verse had more than doubled in length, to four hundred and eighty-two names.

Newspapers sang the praises of the light regiment and its dauntless courage. The 17th Hussars had not only charged the guns on the heights of Haolien: they had charged into history and left their bloody mark on the proud annals of the Army. One too-pragmatic commentator had condemned Colonel Augustus Finch for his handling of the regiment, and the question had been raised in parliament, but all such condemnation had been shouted down. Besides, the colonel had not been at fault.

All of that blood was on Thorne's hands.

All those pretty boys. Eighteen, nineteen, perhaps twenty-one years of age. Most of them still unmarried. All of them with mothers who wrote them to say how they hoped their sons would return soon, and safe, and whose fathers perhaps loved them, even if they could not say it. Boys with brothers and sisters who mourned them even while pretending to be proud. Boys with sweethearts left lonely, with dreams shattered by shellfire, cut down by rifle bullets, torn asunder by the violence of war.

As the Hussars marched in parade, and as they sang the return, Thorne foundered in the midst of the gravity of his mistake. His throat closed up, and only his mount's long-trained habits kept him in his proper place in the formation. He had never been so glad for the end of a parade---once his favorite part of being in the army. When the formation was dismissed, he knew just where he would go.

"Ho, there, Lieutenant!" called one of his fellows, a lad called Mitchell by his comrades.

Thorne gave no answer, and Mitchell caught him up quickly, as he lacked the heart to gallop. The pale young man slapped his back as he came alongside.

"You're not already too good to drink with the men, are you?" asked Mitchell, grinning from ear to ear.

"What makes you think I want a drink?"

"Well, it's nearly noon, and what else have you done lately?"

Part of the cavalry's reputation for indiscipline stemmed from this: the comparative familiarity between officers and men. Even ordinary troopers of the cavalry were, after all, usually of noble birth; they didn't think of their officers as being cut from different cloth, unlike the men of the Rifles or the Foot. Thorne had never minded that until now.

Another trooper rode up beside them as they wound through the narrow side street, this one named Barclay. These three had entered in the same levy---though they had once been seven in number. The Immortal Seven, as Harvey Donne had been wont to say.

Donne had survived the charge but taken shrapnel through both lungs. By sheer audacity, or through foolish pride, he had reached the heights and seen the Carolingians routed before he fell from the saddle. Naively, Thorne first mistook the chalky pallor of his face for actual chalk before realizing that his friend had been bled completely white.

"You, at least," he said as he lay dying, "are still immortal. Give my sister a kiss from me?"

Thorne did not know where the others had fallen, but he knew that much of the newest levy had fared poorly in the battle. They had much to learn of being shot at and only scant seconds to learn it. Given their blistering baptism of fire, perhaps it was surprising that only four of the Immortal Seven had been killed in action.

"Not again," said Barclay. "Not so early in the day."

"It's guilt," said Mitchell. "Did you see him in action?"

"No, but I heard he cut down a dozen."

"A dozen be damned---it was a full score, and I watched with my own eyes!"

"There's nothing to be ashamed of, Caz," said Barclay, "and that's the truth of it. They were fighting men every one. You did what any gentleman ought to do. It is no sin to slay the enemy in the midst of action."

"He's right," said Mitchell. "I only wish I had managed to get stuck in before they fled. That animal of yours is magnificent. I've never seen one faster! Although, I suppose it's possible you just weigh less than the rest of us. What about you, Bark? Did you get one?"

"I crossed swords with a grenadier," said Barclay, "or maybe that was his bayonet, but my horse carried me past before we could conclude our business with one another. Captain Peters gutted one. Oh, it was a dreadful sight!"

"Anyway, you should feel proud. I'm told you've been gazetted. Everyone will know you're a hero!"

Proud? Hero? Proud of what? Of heroically getting half his regiment killed? Thorne pulled at the visor of his cap, and he sat straighter in the saddle. "I just realized," he said, keeping his voice blank and unreadable, "I forgot something."

(He runs off or rides off or something---just flees from his friends.)
