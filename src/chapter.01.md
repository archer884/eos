# Chapter 1

Thunder echoed from the far ridge: the report of cannon, and the burst of shellfire. Smoke, drifting from the gun pits cut in the sticky chalk of the Haolien Valley, stung the eyes and caught in the throat. A faint flash and a glut of gray smoke was the only sign as the guns on the heights made reply, sending their metal rain back into the valley to tear new craters in the chalk, and to tear men asunder.

Cries rang out, sharp and rending, and clods of earth fell across the shallow trenches of Her Majesty's Own 51st Rifles. This Hell was theirs, and had been theirs alone for three days. Now, without water, short on ammunition, and shelled to ribbons, they were ready to break. Now the hammer would fall. Now, into this Hell, rode the 17th Hussars.

Pretty boys on pretty horses. Oh, how they shine!

Do they know which end of a shovel goes into the earth?

Don't be cross, lads. The battle is over. Don't you see? The Gray Goats would never risk so many noble sons.

Oh, but they would. Easier to risk noble sons, because noble sons lacked the courage to flee in the face of the enemy. A private soldier might turn and run, break and save himself, but a baron's boy? It would be suicide. Better to die than to face that shame: better to be un-made than un-manned, and to be cast out from all he had known. So it was that the pretty boy on the pretty horse was caught between two fears, and those fears warred to see which was the greater.

His name was Thorne. His sword, etched with the family's most ancient motto, declared *Vincere Vel Mori*---Conquer or Die---and his hand clenched at its hilt so that none could see he was shaking. Yesterday, he had been without fear. Yesterday, the 17th had marched past an abandoned trench.

The boy, only sixteen, could not forget the stench of death. It stuck in his nostrils and clawed at his mind. He could not forget the sight of bloated, sun-baked corpses, or of the flies and their maggots crawling on sightless, yellowed eyes. He could not forget the plaintive cry of a mangled man pleading for water.

Water or death.

Victory or death.

The boy could accept victory or death. He could embrace either, openly, gladly, with joy in his heart, but to spend days in a trench waiting and praying for death to come... Captain Peters had shot the man through the head with a pistol, at last granting him relief, but that same relief had not been granted to the boy named Thorne.

Yesterday, the 17th had been issued breach-loading rifles and cartridge belts. Even now, a heavy, brown box pressed painfully into the boy's side, laden with .464 caliber rounds, and the weight of a rifle sling bore down on his narrow shoulder. He could shoot. He had learned to hunt as soon as he had learned to ride, and he had learned to ride almost before he could walk, but the rifle was not a gentleman's weapon. It was crude, and heavy, and stank of tar and rotted eggs, and it represented a coward's way of war. Could they not meet the enemy face to face?

Oh, how glad he would be to meet the enemy! Let him stand nose to nose, blade to blade, and be tested. Let him go out and bleed and die, or kill and conquer, whatever the result, but do not ask him to dig his own grave and lie in it and wait for the end.

For a merciful bullet through the head.

For the sun to bleach and bloat his corpse.

For the sappers to cover him over.

"Hussars, prepare to dismount!"

Apple, the boy's pretty horse, quivered beneath him. The beast felt the thunderous voice of the cannon on the heights through its very hooves, even before the shell had come. An instant later, fragments of scorched and twisted metal pierced the very air, singeing clothing and shredding flesh: the shell had fallen short, activating its fuse as it glanced off the earth, and it burst in the air as it passed by the Hussars. A perfect shot.

Blood gushed, shooting across the white chalk from the throat of the man before him. How lucky that man was, to receive a certain death, quick and painless! Thorne would have cried out but for the heart that pounded in his own throat, and Apple shifted uneasily beneath him, responding to his fear.

And then there was a cry: a wordless, primal scream of impotent rage and fear. There was a cry, accompanied by the silent whisper of steel as his family sword sprang from the scabbard, and only as the blade rose up, blazing under the harsh blue sky, did Thorne realize that cry was his. He shrugged off the weight of the rifle on his shoulder, threw down his cartridge box, and he broke from the regiment.

He ran. He was running. Without orders. Against orders. But he was not a coward. Never let it be said that he ran from the enemy, or that he feared death. Let them say that he sought death with greater sincerity, with more eagerness, than others.

<!-- Change "He ran. He was running." Go with "Rode"? -->

Apple sailed across the shallow trench and his hooves tore chalk from the earth, and Thorne galloped toward the heights with his sword raised. The next shell only just missed him, skipping off the earth a few feet to the right of him. It detonated just behind him, deafening him as it showered the regiment with more shrapnel. Blinded by the spray of chalk from the glancing shell, he rode on, trusting his mount to run toward battle and the thunder of guns. He and his red horse were alike in their breeding.

Not until tears had bled the chalk from his eyes did Thorne realize that he was not alone. The regiment rode with him. Perhaps they thought an order had been given, or perhaps all control had been lost. Noble sons, like their horses, are spirited beasts, and given to eagerness. The thunder of guns and hooves filled the valley below the heights, and the Hussars rode into the mouth of Hell.
