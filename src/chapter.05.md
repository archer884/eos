# Chapter 5

A regiment's song had three verses: the levy, the parting, and the return. There was no verse for battle, for that part was sung by hard, ringing steel, the booming voice of guns, and the rattle of rifle fire; by the scream of horses and the dying and the damned; by the silence that ruled when the armies had gone. The silence of the grave, broken only by the cries of carrion birds wheeling in the blue sky.

There was, however, a fourth verse.

Each regiment's fourth verse, the Long Verse, was known only to the members of the regiment. When it was sung---if ever it was sung---it was only on the way to battle. That verse consisted of the names of the regiment's fallen. For the 17th Hussars, the Long Verse began with the Battle of Hoarfront, with the names of Andrew Marlbrew, William Easton, Samuel Atick, and Earnest Pettigrew. Four Hussars had fallen on the Hoarfront, in the first combat listed among the regiment's battle honors, and their sacrifice had begun the Long Verse.

In nearly one hundred years of service to the Atlantean Empire, that verse had grown to only two hundred and fourteen names. In a single day---one, black day in Haolien---that verse had more than doubled in length, to four hundred and eighty-two names.

Newspapers sang the praises of the light regiment and its dauntless courage. The 17th Hussars had not only charged the guns on the heights of Haolien: they had charged into history and left their bloody mark on the proud annals of the Army. One too-pragmatic commentator had condemned Colonel Augustus Finch for his handling of the regiment, and the question had been raised in parliament, but all such condemnation had been shouted down. Besides, the colonel had not been at fault.

All of that blood was on Thorne's hands.

All those pretty boys. Eighteen, nineteen, perhaps twenty-one years of age. Most of them still unmarried. All of them with mothers who wrote them to say how they hoped their sons would return soon, and safe, and whose fathers perhaps loved them, even if they could not say it. Boys with brothers and sisters who mourned them even while pretending to be proud. Boys with sweethearts left lonely, with dreams shattered by shellfire, cut down by rifle bullets, torn asunder by the violence of war.

As the Hussars marched in parade, and as they sang the return, Thorne foundered in the midst of the gravity of his mistake. His throat closed up, and only his mount's long-trained habits kept him in his proper place in the formation. He had never been so glad for the end of a parade---once his favorite part of being in the army. When the formation was dismissed, he knew just where he would go.

"Ho, there, Lieutenant!" shouted one of his fellows, a lad called Mitchell by his comrades.

Thorne gave no answer, and Mitchell caught him up quickly, as Thorne lacked the heart to gallop. The pale young man slapped his back as he came alongside.

"You're not already too good to drink with the men, are you?" asked Mitchell, grinning from ear to ear.

"What makes you think I want a drink?"

"Well, it's nearly noon, and what else have you done lately?"

Part of the cavalry's reputation for indiscipline stemmed from this: the comparative familiarity between officers and men. Even ordinary troopers of the cavalry were, after all, usually of noble birth; they didn't think of their officers as being cut from different cloth, unlike the men of the Rifles or the Foot. Thorne had never minded that until now.

Another trooper, this one named Barclay, rode up beside them as they wound through the narrow side street. These three had entered in the same levy---though they had once been seven in number. The Immortal Seven, as Harvey Donne had been wont to say.

Donne had survived the charge but taken shrapnel through both lungs. By sheer audacity, or through foolish pride, he had reached the heights and seen the Carolingians put to rout before he fell from the saddle. Naively, Thorne first mistook the chalky pallor of his face for actual chalk before realizing that his friend had been bled completely white.

"You, at least," he said as he lay dying, "are still immortal. Give my sister a kiss from me?"

Thorne did not know where the others had fallen, but he knew that much of the newest levy had fared poorly in the battle. They had much to learn of being shot at and only scant seconds to learn it. Given their blistering baptism of fire, perhaps it was surprising that only four of the Immortal Seven had been killed in action.

"Not again," said Barclay. "Not so early in the day."

"It's guilt," said Mitchell. "Did you see him in action?"

"No, but I heard he cut down a dozen."

"A dozen be damned. It was a full score---and I watched with my own eyes!"

"There's nothing to be ashamed of, Caz," said Barclay, "and that's the truth of it. They were fighting men every one. You did what any gentleman ought to do. It is no sin to slay the enemy in the midst of action."

"He's right," said Mitchell. "I only wish I had managed to get stuck in before they fled. That animal of yours is magnificent. I've never seen one faster! Although, I suppose it's possible you just weigh less than the rest of us. What about you, Bark? Did you get one?"

"I crossed swords with a grenadier," said Barclay, "or maybe that was his bayonet, but my horse carried me past before we could conclude our business. Captain Peters gutted one. Oh, it was a dreadful sight!"

"Anyway, you should feel proud. I'm told you've been gazetted. Everyone will know you're a hero!"

Proud? Hero? Proud of what? Of heroically getting half his regiment killed? Thorne pulled at the visor of his cap, and he sat straighter in the saddle. "I just realized," he said, keeping his voice blank and unreadable, "I forgot something."

(He goes to get into a fight with drunk-ass Salter?)
